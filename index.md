# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 19: January 16, 2020

Due to resource (airplane) scheduling constraints, we were only able to sneak in a quick flight this morning. Because of that, we abandoned the idea of going to Watsonville, and instead took our talents to Hayward (my first time flying there).

### Flight

This weekend's flight went significantly better than last week's, possibly just because last week I was a bit out of practice, while this week, I had only six days off. My roll-outs were all much much better than they were last week. Something I was thinking about was how to do the "whoa horsie" movement better. The way to do it is flare, put down the nose, then slow down with brake and pull up just a bit, in order to not yank the airplane back off the ground. Having had that on my mind the whole last week, i was better able to handle the airplane.

The Hayward pattern is a little strange - it's only 650 feet AGL. This means that instead of throttling back with the flaps abeam the numbers, we need to throttle back late, about as we enter the turn base. It also means we have to do everything a bit quicker. It was good to go somewhere new this time.

My biggest issue was the open feedback loop. The idea being when we do something, we wait for it to take effect, and then observe whether it achieved what we wanted it to. If it did, we don't need to take further action. If it didn't, we repeat the process. Just doing the procedure only gets us into the right ballpark. Another philosophical issue is the decisions about power reductions. Steve's methodology is to make only two power reductions (once for the initial descent, and then again after the runway is made, pull power to idle). Andrew's methodology is to fix the point where you make the flap changes and use power to micromanage the altitude on base/final. It's interesting to try it both ways.

Now, onto the mechanical issues. I tended to drop the right wing during the climb rather than applying a little bit of right rudder. Also (and 4660G has a worse tendency than others in this regard), I actually need to hold a lot of right rudder during the left turns through the pattern (especially the turn crosswind). I am still making the same mistake about trim (holding too much pressure, then letting go in order to test) that I usually do. Finally, I tend to not trust my trim setting on final and pull back, despite the fact that I need to be going a bit faster. Also, I need to do better at judging the turn-in point for turning final. During the round out and flare, I need to do a better job of studying the drift and correcting during the flare rather than after it. In general, I need to make smaller and gentler inputs regardless of what those inputs are. Finally, I just need to relax and slow down my brain. I can keep up with things enough that I really don't need to rush myself, if I could just relax.

## Flight 18: January 10, 2020

After the first-solo debacle and then a COVID scare (had a negative test, so I am mostly out of the woods), I ended up unfortunately taking three weeks off from flying. Honestly, I was a little apprehensive coming back into it today. Also, because of some scheduling issues, I flew with Steve Philipson again. I find that his style is almost equally conducive to learning as Andrew's, though it is very different.

### Flight

We had a pretty good flight. For a while, Steve and I exchanged stories and discussed the physics of various types of approaches-to-land, and doing a very detailed weather breif, including talking about various weather phenomena and mountain wave wind patterns, while waiting for the IFR weather to burn off. We also talked about some of the things that tend to happen in California in the winter, like various kinds of valley fog and marine layer and so on.

We did a pre-flight and took off for our usual left-downwind departure towards Watsonville. After our normal 1500 ft/90 kt sanity-check and call to NorCal, we headed towards the Lexington Reservoir. This time, there was not a particularly good gap between the top of the mountains and the bottom of the clouds. We decided to divert around the hills and flew in through the Coyote valley, passing abeam San Martin.

After taking a moment to go over the hills and clouds (which was pretty cool), we descended down into the pattern at Watsonville. All in all, we did twelve times around the pattern. Many of them were good. Several of them were not as good. I am making progress on combatting my "landing too flat" habit, and have a couple of strategies to help me do so. One issue is continuing to look straight ahead but using my peripheral vision. If I look slightly out the side of the window, I will feel more reasonable about not being able to see ahead of me. I will also be able to see my drift and sink rates more effectively. The second issue is being too abrupt with my control inputs. This is true everywhere from taxiing to flying to landing. Everything should be a small input followed by giving time for the input to take effect. This problem is what caused my porpoise when I was solo. I needed to flare more gently and slowly, and hold the input and let the airplane sink. This even extends to my trim technique. I should work on using as little control pressure as possible, with a goal of just a finger. All in all, it was a good way to get back used to flying again.
