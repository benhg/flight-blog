# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 28: 3/13/2021
The main message of today was crosswinds, and a little bit of an introduction to soft-field approach-to-land. It was a difficult day for me but it was also good for me. I've got some things I need to work on, but it was really good for me to get some exposure to real crosswinds. We stayed in the palo alto pattern, which was unusually pretty empty. That was probably because of the crosswind encounter. The METAR was something crazy, like 180/16G19, but what we observed from our actual experience was more like 295/16G19. There was only ever a crosswind of five or six knots, but there were lots of gusts and a big headwind encounter to make things more complicated too.
I really need to work on the crosswind inputs (sideslips). I was getting better at it by the end of the lesson, but I am a little shy about the rudder. I almost need to go full rudder and fix the centerline alignment with aileron, rather than using the aileron to correct for the crosswind and applying opposite rudder to stay on the centerline. We had a light right crosswind at the threshold but a very strong left crosswind on the far end of the runway. So that combined with the fact that you slow down and the rudder loses authority, and you really have to lay on the left aileron during the rollout. After that, during a takeoff/go-around, you need to switch over to steering with the rudder promptly. There's just a lot going on. Doing all of the crosswind correction is really tiring. I am a little nervous about doing it solo once I start returning to Palo Alto by myself. The first several landings were kind of rough as I was warming up and the winds were weird. I had to go around a few times in a row at one point. I also needed to look at the altimeter a lot less, and rely more on timing and experience.  We talked about slowing down in the downwind, and that we can aim for 85 kts or so if it makes life easier. Because of the crosswind, we needed to do a lot of crab heading on the downwind leg. That was weird at first, but I got used to it by the end. We also kept getting extended by ATC (A Palo Alto special). We talked about not descending at all if they extend us. If they extend us, we don't descend until we're on final and we have a white white or red/white VASI. I was getting most of that but I wasn't making the necessary power changes when I knew I needed to. I need to focus more on just doing things rather than saying them out loud and then doing them. My turn timing and steepness is getting pretty good, but I need to be better about trusting myself to do it, rather than asking questions. I asked a lot of questions to which I knew the answer. We also practiced a few no-flaps landings, most of which went well, but one of them I completely forgot how to do it. For reference, we go to power 1500 on final and descend at 500 ft/min. Then, we go power idle and start to slow down and trim for L/DMax, before adding power as necessary. We also tried a couple of power-off approaches, which went pretty well! My glide judgement went fine and I was able to get the airplane on the ground both times. I still need to get better about applying the flaps as soon as the runway is made, and then pitching down to keep the flying speed. THe biggest problem I had was landing flat and fast a couple times. I need to have the power all the way off and be in a full-stall attitude when I am flaring. Will keep that in mind going forward.
Before we did our flight, we also discussed soft-field approach to land. Here's the steps from our discussion:
Objective: Land on soft, grassy, or muddy terrain. To do this, we need to be extra gentle on the nose gear and attempt to land with as little vertical speed as possible. To do this, we need more airspeed than usual. That makes the airplane harder to flare and more sensitive to crosswinds.
0. We perfrom a normal approach to land, as usual
1. Upon reaching short final, adjust or delay power reduction, before rotating into ground effect.
	- Carry as much power as is necessary to penetrate headwind encounter
	- While maintaining approach angle, add power to achieve a minimal descent rate
2. Upon rotating into ground effect, pitch for level with a slight power increase, in order to further minimize rate of descent
3. Make slight power reduction to allow for a soft touchdown in a nose-high attitude. Make sure crosswind inputs are as they should be
4. Apply sufficient power and up elevator to hold nose off the ground (pop a wheelie). Maintain aileron into the wind.
5. Reduce power to just above idle for roll out off of the runway, in a wide turn without applying brake.


## Flight 27/First XC: 3/6/2021
After the stage check with Libor (decided not to write that one up because it was pretty standard: bunch of landings and a simulated emergency and a couple other things), Andrew suggested we take advantage of the fact that we still have a week before daylight savings time starts and check off the nighttime requirements. Those requirements are one dual night XC and ten full-stop night landings, as well as three hours of night instruction. We decided to use this to take a little break from the patternwork and do something new. So we headed out to Modesto (which, at 63 NMi is just over the 50 NMi minimum requirement to be a cross-country flight.) We also took the time to introduce me to a few things related to cross country navigation, flight planning, and fuel planning. Andrew has come up with a brilliant format for a navigation log, which we use to help do navigational planning, fuel calculations, and estimate the corrections we are going to need to make for wind. I will do a more thorough blog post about how to do the nav logging once I get closer to doing solo cross-countries. We ended up deciding to use mostly GPS intersections, and finally the KMOD VOR for the last turn. The route was KPAO VPKGO SUNOL VPBCB VPALT KTCY 1Q4 KMOD, and the reverse route on the way back, except for a lack of 1Q4, which we only used because it was very close to our computed top of climb. We also talked to an actual weather briefer, which was an interesting experience. I appreciate people with such specialized skills. Hopefully weather briefers will continue to be a thing going forward.
Flying at night is strange. All sorts of weird optical illusions and terrain is kind of spooky. When we flew over mountains it was really dark and kind of weird. The other side is that because of how well lit the airplanes are, it's really easy to find other traffic nearby. Landing at night is really really weird. It actually gets harder as runways get wider. That's because the runway edges are lit, but the centerline usually isn't (I am not ready to fly at O'Hare or SFO yet.) So it feels like you're being swallowed up by the darkness as you hit the ground. The airplane we flew also had really wimpy ass taxi and landing lights, so it's even harder to see the runway. For this reason, we carry extra power and hold the airplane off the runway for a little longer. Modesto has a pretty long runway so it's not a big deal to use a little extra. We even did a couple of landings with no runway edge lighting. That was extra super disorienting. We headed back to Palo Alto and did five night landings there. It was similar but the runway was only half as wide. We were both really tired by the end of it. Finished at about 11:30. If it was the next week and we were post-daylight savings, it would have been 12:30 instead.

## Flight 25: February 17, 2021
Took the afternoon off of work to go flying today, because Andrew had a conflict this Saturday. Had an excellent short flight, possibly my best yet in terms of not getting behind the airplane and following the proper procedure in the pattern. Easily my best landings at Palo Alto. And surprisingly, I wasn't really put off by the headwind encounter like I was last week. We had originally intended to head over to Reid-Hillview for some crosswind practice, but we got stuck on the ground for a while waiting for the fuel truck, so we ended up staying in the pattern at Palo Alto. The pattern at Palo Alto is a weird one, but it will also be my home airport once I am flying on my own (first as a solo student pilot and later as the holder of a newly minted PPL [I hope at least]). So it was good to get some practice. 

Overall, I did a much much better job of controlling the airplane than last saturday, which was one of my worse sessions. And Palo Alto is not really a beginner airport. So that makes me happy. I still didn't do everything perfect, and in fact there were a few things I did wrong several times. The first and biggest mistake I was making regularly was turning final early (undershooting the turn), which cuts into the time we spend in the descent on final. That time on final is important to us as pilots because it's time we can use to study our sink rate and crosswind inputs. I got progressively better at that throughout the session. When we have headwinds on base, we need to turn even later than we think we do. And the turn base is a medium steepness turn. Another mistake I was making around the base area was not crabbing enough at the end of the turn base. I needed to be aiming for a more than 90 degree turn base to get us on a crab heading but didn't always do so. My crosswind turn was surprisingly okay, maybe tending to be a little steep at first. The Palo Alto crosswind turn is also strange. The noise abatement turn followed by a continuous crosswind to downwind turn is weird to get used to. Finally, I also made two mistakes in the flare. First, I was tending to flare a little high, but I was correcting for that pretty well. Second, I was releasing the backpressure on the flare too early. The drag from the flare attitude does a lot of the work of slowing down the airplane. I think maybe more than the brakes.


We got lots of practice with slow flight and being told to do weird things by the tower. That was good for me to learn what to do. My slow flight has gotten much better. I am not losing altitude on the entry as much any more. We also practiced slow flight at both 20 degrees and 30 degrees of flaps. That was interesting too. My radio communication was also solid. My approaches especially on final were stable. Sometimes I would oscillate above and below the glideslope a bit, but I was usually able to get the trim correct. Later on, we did a few no-flaps landings. We talked about how when on long-final for no flaps landing, you should be going faster than usual (approx 80 kt with power 1500 and nose on the VASI). This is because with less drag, if you want to slow to 65, you need to be in near a flare attitude while flying. Then, you pull power idle and start nosing up, in order to dissipate the energy of the airplane. If necessary, you can add power to drag the airplane to the runway. But we err on the side of pulling power early, because we can always add power (assuming no engine failure) but it is hard to dissipate extra energy with no flaps.
