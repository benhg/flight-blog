# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 28: 3/13/2021
The main message of today was crosswinds, and a little bit of an introduction to soft-field approach-to-land. It was a difficult day for me but it was also good for me. I've got some things I need to work on, but it was really good for me to get some exposure to real crosswinds. We stayed in the palo alto pattern, which was unusually pretty empty. That was probably because of the crosswind encounter. The METAR was something crazy, like 180/16G19, but what we observed from our actual experience was more like 295/16G19. There was only ever a crosswind of five or six knots, but there were lots of gusts and a big headwind encounter to make things more complicated too.
I really need to work on the crosswind inputs (sideslips). I was getting better at it by the end of the lesson, but I am a little shy about the rudder. I almost need to go full rudder and fix the centerline alignment with aileron, rather than using the aileron to correct for the crosswind and applying opposite rudder to stay on the centerline. We had a light right crosswind at the threshold but a very strong left crosswind on the far end of the runway. So that combined with the fact that you slow down and the rudder loses authority, and you really have to lay on the left aileron during the rollout. After that, during a takeoff/go-around, you need to switch over to steering with the rudder promptly. There's just a lot going on. Doing all of the crosswind correction is really tiring. I am a little nervous about doing it solo once I start returning to Palo Alto by myself. The first several landings were kind of rough as I was warming up and the winds were weird. I had to go around a few times in a row at one point. I also needed to look at the altimeter a lot less, and rely more on timing and experience.  We talked about slowing down in the downwind, and that we can aim for 85 kts or so if it makes life easier. Because of the crosswind, we needed to do a lot of crab heading on the downwind leg. That was weird at first, but I got used to it by the end. We also kept getting extended by ATC (A Palo Alto special). We talked about not descending at all if they extend us. If they extend us, we don't descend until we're on final and we have a white white or red/white VASI. I was getting most of that but I wasn't making the necessary power changes when I knew I needed to. I need to focus more on just doing things rather than saying them out loud and then doing them. My turn timing and steepness is getting pretty good, but I need to be better about trusting myself to do it, rather than asking questions. I asked a lot of questions to which I knew the answer. We also practiced a few no-flaps landings, most of which went well, but one of them I completely forgot how to do it. For reference, we go to power 1500 on final and descend at 500 ft/min. Then, we go power idle and start to slow down and trim for L/DMax, before adding power as necessary. We also tried a couple of power-off approaches, which went pretty well! My glide judgement went fine and I was able to get the airplane on the ground both times. I still need to get better about applying the flaps as soon as the runway is made, and then pitching down to keep the flying speed. THe biggest problem I had was landing flat and fast a couple times. I need to have the power all the way off and be in a full-stall attitude when I am flaring. Will keep that in mind going forward.
Before we did our flight, we also discussed soft-field approach to land. Here's the steps from our discussion:
Objective: Land on soft, grassy, or muddy terrain. To do this, we need to be extra gentle on the nose gear and attempt to land with as little vertical speed as possible. To do this, we need more airspeed than usual. That makes the airplane harder to flare and more sensitive to crosswinds.
0. We perfrom a normal approach to land, as usual
1. Upon reaching short final, adjust or delay power reduction, before rotating into ground effect.
	- Carry as much power as is necessary to penetrate headwind encounter
	- While maintaining approach angle, add power to achieve a minimal descent rate
2. Upon rotating into ground effect, pitch for level with a slight power increase, in order to further minimize rate of descent
3. Make slight power reduction to allow for a soft touchdown in a nose-high attitude. Make sure crosswind inputs are as they should be
4. Apply sufficient power and up elevator to hold nose off the ground (pop a wheelie). Maintain aileron into the wind.
5. Reduce power to just above idle for roll out off of the runway, in a wide turn without applying brake.


## Flight 27/First XC: 3/6/2021

After the stage check with Libor (decided not to write that one up because it was pretty standard: bunch of landings and a simulated emergency and a couple other things), Andrew suggested we take advantage of the fact that we still have a week before daylight savings time starts and check off the nighttime requirements. Those requirements are one dual night XC and ten full-stop night landings, as well as three hours of night instruction. We decided to use this to take a little break from the patternwork and do something new. So we headed out to Modesto (which, at 63 NMi is just over the 50 NMi minimum requirement to be a cross-country flight.) We also took the time to introduce me to a few things related to cross country navigation, flight planning, and fuel planning. Andrew has come up with a brilliant format for a navigation log, which we use to help do navigational planning, fuel calculations, and estimate the corrections we are going to need to make for wind. I will do a more thorough blog post about how to do the nav logging once I get closer to doing solo cross-countries. We ended up deciding to use mostly GPS intersections, and finally the KMOD VOR for the last turn. The route was KPAO VPKGO SUNOL VPBCB VPALT KTCY 1Q4 KMOD, and the reverse route on the way back, except for a lack of 1Q4, which we only used because it was very close to our computed top of climb. We also talked to an actual weather briefer, which was an interesting experience. I appreciate people with such specialized skills. Hopefully weather briefers will continue to be a thing going forward.
Flying at night is strange. All sorts of weird optical illusions and terrain is kind of spooky. When we flew over mountains it was really dark and kind of weird. The other side is that because of how well lit the airplanes are, it's really easy to find other traffic nearby. Landing at night is really really weird. It actually gets harder as runways get wider. That's because the runway edges are lit, but the centerline usually isn't (I am not ready to fly at O'Hare or SFO yet.) So it feels like you're being swallowed up by the darkness as you hit the ground. The airplane we flew also had really wimpy ass taxi and landing lights, so it's even harder to see the runway. For this reason, we carry extra power and hold the airplane off the runway for a little longer. Modesto has a pretty long runway so it's not a big deal to use a little extra. We even did a couple of landings with no runway edge lighting. That was extra super disorienting. We headed back to Palo Alto and did five night landings there. It was similar but the runway was only half as wide. We were both really tired by the end of it. Finished at about 11:30. If it was the next week and we were post-daylight savings, it would have been 12:30 instead.
