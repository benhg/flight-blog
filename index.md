# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)


## Flight 2: September 19, 2020


## Flight 1: September 8, 2020

NOTE: this flight entry was made well after the flight occurred, so the formatting won't be perfect by any means.

### GROUND

Before flying:

- Restricted zones
- NOTAM & weather
- Check out plane

LOGBOOK ENTRY:
Logbook entry must contain: 

- Name
- Tail number
- Date/time (Zulu[UTC] and Local)
- Weather briefing (more info later)
- Hobbs time - start
- Tach time - start
- (fill in others, once you land)
- Time up and time down

### AIR / Theory:

#### Maneuvers:

##### Climb:

1. Pitch (Up, a bit above horizon)
2. Power (increase)
3. Trim (to release controle stick pressure)

##### Turns:

###### LEFT:

1. Bank  (aileron)
2. Rudder (not necessary for left)
3. PITCH constantly
4. Trim (if nec.) for long turns
5. Out with RIGHT RUDDER

###### RIGHT:

1. Ball (Left rudder)
2. Make sure not overbanking (60 deg feels like wheeeee)
3. Pitch constantly
4. OUT with AILERON and then RUDDER

##### DESCENT:

1. Opposite of CLIMB but more complicated. It's more complex beacause climbing is power-limited. Can descend in many ways.


### NOTES:

- Ground-level (taxi): Tend to go right due to extra braking on Right. Focus on extra left-side braking
- More right rudder, in general. THe plane really wants to go to the left.
- For left turns: aileron in, out with right rudder pedal. For right turns, in with rudder, out with aileron + rudder (in that order)
- Do better at keeping plane level through turns. Through a turn, continually check crosshair against horizon
