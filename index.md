# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

## Flight 5: October 3, 2020

Today, we didn't try anything new, just practiced the things I was having the most trouble with. Those things are power-off stalls, steep turns, and slow flight. Today the air was extremely smokey and didn't have great visibility, so we held off on power-on stalls, which we need a good strong horizon to practice with. Overall, I had a great flight. I felt a lot more comfortable than I have before with the controls. I still made plenty of mistakes, as expected, but I also felt a lot more in control than last week, for example.

### Ground, Pre-Flight
Today's pre-flight was abbreviated, because Andrew ran a bit late, and we weren't doing anything new. I did create an account in IACRA and signed up to get an official student pilot certificate, which will allow me to legally solo, once it's time. I do not forsee that happening any time soon, but it's nice to get the paperwork out of the way. We did a quick weather briefing, talked about how the haze and smoke were definitely going to be a factor today, and got on our way. We flew in 305RS, which is one of the newest planes in Aviation's fleet. We noticed that it hadn't been perfectly put away. The control lock was out, light switches were in the wrong positions, and the avionics master switch was on.

## Ground Instruction, Session 1: October 1, 2020

Today, I had my first ground-instruction session. In ground instruction, I will learn more about things like the physics of flight, necessary meteorological knowlege, flight planning and decision making, and other necessary things that are not directly related to flying. For our ground instruction, I am using the Jeppesen's Privot Pilot's Manual (aviators really like to call books "Manuals"). Today, we covered chapters 1, 2, and 3. There were several things that I thought I would know, that it turned out I did not.

### Chapter 1

#### Section A
Section A covers some basic background, mostly things that I already know. Because of this, my entry about it will be rather short. We covered things like how long class III medical certificates last (which is 5 years, counted by calendar months, not counted by calendar days. This means you can effectively get a free month by getting your certificate on the first of the month). We also talked about the two most important what it means to be the pilot in command of an aircraft Additionally, we covered airplane class and category. Category refers to the overall type of the aircraft: "Airplane" is a category, as is "lighter-than air", "rotorcraft", and so on. "Class" refers to a more specific type. For example, "Single-engine, Land" is the kind of aircraft I am learning to fly right now. There are also "Single-engine, Sea", "Multi-engine, Land", and "Multi-engine, Sea" airplanes, as well as gliders. Finally, we spoke about logbooks and how while the only legally requrired logbook entries are for training and currency, it is a very good idea to keep rigorous logbooks.

#### Section B

Section B is titled "Aviation Opportunities," and there are only a couple of useful pieces of information in it. We talked about airplane cagetories based on plane load limits, which include normal, utility, aerobatic, and so on. We talked about where in a pilot's operating handbook this information all lives. We also talked about a couple of groups (notably the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association). Finally, we talked about various ratings and endorsements which I could get, once I have a pilot's certificate. These include a tailwheel endorsement, an instrument or MEI rating, a seaplane rating, or a high-performance or complex endorsement. We also talked about type ratings, which apply to planes with a weight of over 12.5 thousand pounds, or which use jet fuel, or which have turbine engines. 

#### Section C

Section B covers an introduction to human factors. During this section, we talked about a number of things, most of which can fit either into the category of Aeronautical Decision Making and Pilot In Command Responsibility. We talked about how A.D.M. includes things like making good decisions about whether to make a flight or not, given weather conditions, whether to make maneuvers we paln to, and other decisions in or related to airplanes. We talked about Single-Pilot and Crew Resource Management. We talked about how it's important that a pilot learns to do everything inside an airplane, in order to make sure that they are able to manage a flight themself. We also talked about the accident chain. Consider an example: Let's say I promised to be my friend's best man in his wedding tomorrow in L.A. I wake up the morning of after a late night out. Initially, I had hoped to leave early in the morning, but I got sidetracked with errands and work. By the time I make it to the airport, I'm already running late. I abbreviate my pre-flight and fail to check my fuel levels. I take off into deteriorating weather conditions, because I decide I have to get to LA ASAP. Now, winds are picking up, and it's starting to rain. Clouds are rolling in. Midway through my flight I notice I'm low on fuel. Now the sun is setting, and there is a layer of clouds below me. I try to land to the minimums at a nearby airport, but the fog goes too low. I have to do a go-around while I'm having a fuel emergency. Bad things can happen in this situation. The whole thing could have been avoided if I just didn't have a long night out last night.

After that, we talked about how to manage resources. We talked about how resources can include things like charts, information on ipads, communication with ATC, other pilots, people around the club, autopilot, in-plane technology, and other things. We also talked about how situational awareness is important, and that essentially, situational awareness is about paying attention to what's going on. We compared airplane situational awareness to that when one is operating a car. We remarked about how one needs to constantly be looking at engine gauges and instruments, and paying attention to the radios, looking at the horizon, and paying attention to wind and weather conditions.

We also went over the following acronyms to understand when it is safe to fly:

```
Illness
Medication

Sleep/Stress
Alcohol
Fatigue
Eating

and

Macho
Invulnerability
Impulsivity
Resignation
Anti-authority
```

### Chapter 2

#### Airplanes

We talked about the powerplant, fuselage, and empennage. The Powerplant is the area including the engine, and goes from the propeller back to the firewall. The Fuselage is the whole area that includes the cargo compartments, passengers, and so on. The Empennage is the "tail feathers" - the stabilizers and control surfaces. We talked about monocoque and semi-monocoque designs. With a monocoque, the skin is structural, and tension in the skin is important to the structural stability of the plane. In a semi-monocoque design, the skin of the plane is reinforced with struts and "ribs" such that a dent or break in any single section of the plane does not harm the structural integrity of the plane. We talked about how flaps provide extra lift and also extra drag. They can be used to slow down the plane, as well as to allow for slow-flight by increasing the amount of lift. We also talked about how planes can fly with flaps extended at speeds higher than VFE.

We talked about landing gear, and the difference between tricycle and tailwheel, and the fact that gear is made of an alloy called "spring steel" which has a stress-strain curve that allows it to experience a lot of elastic deformation, which makes it stand up to landings better. We talked about how Cessnas do not have antilock brakes, and as such are quite easy to flat-spot tyres on.

We also talked about some abnormalities of light aircraft engines. First, they have removable cylinders, rather than a block like normal car engines. They are also almost always aircooled. They have pushrod valves, and valve timing is adjusted by changing the length of the pushrods. They also are not very efficient, because they need to burn a lot of fuel, in order to create enough torque to drag a plane through the sky. Finally, they are canted to the right, because they have left-turning tendencies. 

#### Documentation

Planes must have specific documentation. We talked about this a bit while we were waiting for fuel last Sunday, but the basic idea is as follows. Since March of 1979, the FAA has required that planes have an FAA approved Pilot's Operating Handbook (Approved Flight Manual). These manuals are certified by the FAA and must contain specific content in a specific order. Additionally, whenever equipment is added to a plane, a supplement must be added to the manual which covers it. The organization is summarized by the acronym below:
```
General
Limitations
Emergency procedures
Normal procedures

Performance

Weight and balance
Airplane and systems
Supplements
Safety
```

### Flight Physics

Relative wind is the movement of air relative to the motion of the airplane. It is measured in relation to the nose of the airplane. The important thing to learn about relative wind is that failing to think about it can lead to strange and dangerous situations. Consider the idea of a level-pitch descent. Now, the relative wind is pointing up, as well as towards the back of the plane. The angle of attack of the wings is thus higher than if the plane was in normal level flight. Therefore, it is possible to stall while pitched lower than the stall angle of the airplane. This needs to be kept in mind. Moving from there, we talked about the concept of angle of attack in general, and how lift is increased as a function of angle of attack, until the critical angle is hit and the plane stalls. We also talked about the aspect ratio of wings and their shapes, and the effects these design decisions have on the planes. 

We moved on to Lift, Drag, Thrust, and Weight. We talked about how weight (which is a vector quantity) vaires in flight with load factor. When you are at 60 degrees of bank, you are experiencing 2Gs of force, as is the rest of the airframe. The propeller energizes the tail and sends high-pressure air at the tail. This gives better control. We also talked about parasite vs indudced drag. Parasite drag, which is what a physicist would just call "drag" is related to airspeed and shape of the airplane, as well as interference from airflow off of various parts of a plane. Induced drag is not actually drag, but is instead a reductuion in lift due to wingtip vortices. The wingtip vortices pull air down behind planes, and essentially "grab" the downwash creating a reduction in lift. We also talked about how the ground-effect is not in fact a "pillow of air" but is instead an effect which occurs at heights too low for the induced drag to exist. Finally, we talked abouut the best-glide speed, which is where overall drag is the lowest. The best glide speed exists at the cross-over between parasite drag and induced drag, and will be the speed where you get the highest lift per drag ratio.

## Logbooks and Note-Taking: September 28, 2020

The FAA requires that you keep an accurate record of all the flights you take. Most pilots keep records in excess of what the FAA deems necessary. I am striving to land on this side of the coin as well. Many people, myself included, keep "official" logbooks on green ledger paper, with entries that look something like this:


![sample-logbook-entry](https://cdn.boldmethod.com/images/learn-to-fly/cfis/logbook-advice-for-every-pilot/3.jpg).

However, I usually fill out my "official" logbook only after the flight is over and the postflight inspection has been done. During the pre-flight and flight, I keep notes in a separate small notebook, which I keep on my kneeboard for easy access while doing other things. I am still working on the format, but I have attached a sample notebook page below as an example.

![inflight-notebook-page](inflight-notebook-page.jpg).

After landing, I fill out my official logbook, enter flight details into ForeFlight on the ipad (preferrably with flight track logs), and have a debrief with Andrew. I take notes pre- and post-flight in a large notebook, and those notes later become the basis of these blog posts.


## Flight 4: September 27, 2020

### Ground, Pre-flight

Went over notes from yesterday’s flight (Andrew and I were both super tired so we did a very minimal debrief last night. Filled in from notes today. This portion of today’s notes have been backported into yesterday’s entry.)

We talked about the power-off stall, why we need to do it, what we are going to do. That is summarized below:

0. Configure plane for slow flight (up to the reintroduction of power) As a reminder, here are the steps:
    1. Power to 1500
    2. Flaps to 10 degrees
    3. Pitch for level
    4. Flaps to 20
    5. Pitch for level
    6. Flaps to full
    7. Pitch for level
1. Now, pull the plane up to start to induce a stall
2. Get to 1.3Vs0, move power to idle (900 RPM)
3. Carefully pull plane up to stall attitude
	Stall attitude is whatever attitude we need to stall (depends on a ton of things)
4. May have to correct pitch with ailerons (gently)
5. At top of maneuver, we experience airflow separation. This is where we feel the stall happen
6. Airplane drops the nose. If we want to recover, we just let the nose drop, and release the backpressure. Then, we go full throttle, and climb out (will touch on recovery later)
7. If we don’t want to recover, and instead want to do the “falling leaf” maneuver, we just hold the plane at the edge of stall, and let it oscillate.
8. Now, here are the details for recovery.
9. Release backpressure and let plane nose fall
10. Promptly but smoothly go to full throttle
11. Aggressively pitch up for a climb
12. Sequentially release flaps, first to 20 degrees, then 10
13. Climb with flaps at 10 degrees.
14. Retract flaps fully when we level off, at a safe altitude.

### Pre-flight
I did most of the pre-flight inspection myself! I am starting to gain confidence with the pre-flight procedure. We spotted a bunch of flat spots on the tyres, and had to go back inside to squawk it. We also needed fuel, and were stuck at the mercy of the fuel truck for quite some time, about 45 minutes. While we waited, we talked about the operating manual, certification process, MFD and radio operation, and did a practice weight and balance calculation, on paper. Once we finally had our fuel, we started up and I taxied away to the run-up area, after asking for permission. Apparently, this is something we only do at PAO, most airports will let you go to the run up area just whenever. Today, I also remembered to hit “record” on ForeFlight before our take off, so I can look at the flight log to evaluate my performance afterwards. The ForeFlight log stopped recording in the middle of the flight, so i have about 2/3rds of the history It’s available here (https://www.foreflight.com/s/track/1601237172-5DEBE476-64C3-4EA0-AF06-0E38C6741518/). We waited in the run-up area for another half an hour or so. There was a whole lot of traffic coming in and out of KPAO, and we had to wait for both.

### In-Flight
 After about 0.5 hobbs-hours of time, we finally got clearance for take-off. Andrew helped me out because we wanted to go fast to allow traffic behind us to continue what they were doing. We took off with a left-dumbarton departure and climbed to 2500 ft, before heading north towards half-moon bay. On the way out there, we got a bit of turbulence coming off the mountains, and requested permission into climb above it. We received said permission and climbed up into a layer of smoke and haze, but no turbulence. Up there, we practiced steep turns, slow flight, and power-out stalls. Power off stalls were a bit scary the first time, but honestly kind of fun. After that, we had to book it back to PAO because the plane had a reservation right after ours. Did a quick landing, taxi and postflight. 

### Post-flight debrief:

If I could only choose one thing from this post-flight, it would have to be “keep your damn hand on the throttle.” I absolutely need to keep the hand on the throttle, especially during maneuvers which require throttle changes throughout. Even when I don’t do such maneuvers, though, I still need to keep the hand there so that I can change the power setting without delay when I need to do so. 

I also need to get better at dealing with turbulence. I am not used to experiencing turbulence in a light aircraft and so I need to be better at just trusting the airplane. Essentially, we were getting non-laminar wind off of the mountains, and it was shaking the plane a bit. Nothing to worry about, but it felt like we were shaking. 

When I do steep turns, I need to be more prompt with the throttle and more precise with trim, so that I can un-trim the plane when I’m done with the maneuver. Also, in the midst of turns, I should not look at the gauges. I should be looking at the horizon, and paying attention to where I’m going. Additionally, I don’t need to look at the throttle, just move it in an inch. Additionally, when I’m in the turn, I need to keep my head in the same place rather than moving over to the left or right. Moving changes my frame of view, and I lose reference to the horizon. This results in inadvertent climbs or dives. At one point I was climbing 300 feet through the course of a 360 degree turn. That’s not ideal (or permissible).

I’m also hesitant to go to the full 45 degrees of bank. I just need to do it when I want to. The crosshair needs to stay in the right place along the horizon. I can also use the glare-shield to measure the angle rather than anything else, because it is close to the windshield and allows me to see outside too. Another thing to remember is that if I screw up a maneuver, I should just stop the maneuver, recalibrate, and try again. 

From today’s slow flight, I need to be better about keeping the crosshair at or above the horizon. I waited too long to deploy flaps. I need to be more prompt about both 10 degree flaps, 20 degree flaps, and full flaps. They all have to be done by the time i hit 1.3Vs0, which is about 65 kts in a C172. I also have to do more right-rudder all the time in slow flight. When the plane weather-vanes with the wind in slow-flight, I correct with opposite-aileron. When turning in slow flight, I need to put the nose down to keep airspeed and add power to keep altitude. That is understandable because slow-flight is in the reverse-command region, so power is controlled by altitude while airspeed is controlled by pitch. Additionally, I should bank as shallow as possible, then add power, and bank more after power is added.

In general, I also need to be smoother with the throttle. In turns, I shouldn't come off of the rudder until the turn is complete. In the power-off stall, I need to be better about putting the mark on the horizon before being ready to stall. Today, because of the haze, the horizon wasn’t clear. I will build intuition about that. Additionally, I need to remember to take the flaps off after level-off, and it’s okay to climb with 10 degrees of flaps deployed. 

Final overall notes: I have a tendency to over-control the airplane. I need to let the plane fly through gusts and turbulence. Andrew likened it to a car going over a speed bump. If you steer the car while going over the bump, you make the bumping tendencies worse. Also, I look at the instruments too much. I need to focus more on the plane and the horizon. 


## Flight 3: September 26, 2020

### GROUND: 
Went over notes, mostly. Talked about takeoffs, steep turns, more on ground reference maneuvers. Talked about specific takeoffs at PAO - gotta go 10 deg to the right, noise abatement reasons.

Main departures: Left-downwind (make a 180 after t.o.), Left dumbarton (make left and follow bridge (after going tendeg right)), right dumbarton (same thing but make a right turn)

Approaches, basically they will tell us what to do. Either NorCal or PAO.


### AIR:
We took a left-downwind departure, towards San Martin. Flew over to san martin at ~1500 feet, rising to 2500. Take-off was a bit rough. I wasn’t so good with the throttle, especially. Also, need to remember to use the friction lock. After takeoff, we flew through SJC’s airspace around to san martin. On the way there, we practiced slow flight a couple of times, and the recovery.

After we got there, we practiced rectangular course, did a touch and go, and finally took off again followed by some ground reference maneuvers. Did a whole bunch of circles, a couple of s-turns. Was quite a gusty day. Winds ~25 kts with gusts in odd directions. Part of that is that it was afternoon. 

Had a lot of trouble finding the right trim today. Not super sure why. Additionally, I felt that i was a bit worse than last week on holding level through maneuvers.

After that, we practiced some steep turns (where there’s a lot going on.) We also practived slow flight again, before really booking it back as the sun was going down. Went over moffet field (whhere we noticed that radio was cutting in and out.) Eventually, moffet handed us off. Noted that KPAO tower was already closed, so we would be landing as if it was a non-towered airport. Did so, with some minor confusion. Moffet told us there was traffic. We did a left-360 to let them go by, moffet informed us they were. at 600 feet and on final. On our approach, we didn’t see anyone. Noticed that there was another plane who was taxiing away from runway. After landing, we saw another plane land just behind us. He had to do a go-around due to the plane we had seen taxiing away.  Little bit of a near miss not helped by the fact that not very much was coming through on the radio.

### Ground, Post-Flight (Backported from tomorrow):

Today’s headset was really irritating. Mic kept flying away from my face so Andrew couldn’t hear me. Additionally, volume was imbalanced and louder in the left ear. Headset had only one volume knob. 

Andrew and I had both noted that the plane was pushing me around all the time. I need to be a little more assertive with the plane at times. Especially on pitch, I need to really tell the plane what I want it to do. I’m definitely not going to break the plane, and I’m not going to drop it out of the sky. Plus, Andrew won’t let me get even close to that.

Additionally, I need to start to internalize the phrase “Aviate, Navigate, Communicate (in that order)”. During take off (which was my first take off) I was a little too concerned with what ATC was saying and not focusing enough on flying the darn plane. 

Another few small notes. Power changes need to be more prompt, and I need to get better about what “without delay” means. When making turns, I need to choose landmarks which are further away from me. That way, I will have a better frame of reference for what a turn’s arc-length is.

I practiced slow-flight a few times, and need to think about some things. The airplane tended to overpower me during slow flight. I noticed I need to use a whole lot more control surface in slow flight, especially right rudder. I also need to be much more aggressive about pitching for level flight, and how that’s different in slow-flight. Also, when I turn, especially in slow flight, I need to be more aggressive about pitching the plane to not gain or lose altitude. 

In general, the deeper the rudder, the more I need to put on opposite aileron to deal with airplane’s overbanking tendencies. In turns, sometimes, especially in slow-flight, I need to add power to maintain altitude. I also need to remember how the reverse-command region works, and how to control altitude with power and airspeed with pitch.

In slow flight recovery, I need to do a couple of things better. First of all, I need to apply flaps more precisely. Additionally, I tend to drop my hand off the throttle. My nhand needs to live on the throttle. I also add too much friction on the friction lock. It needs to be ¼ turn away at all times, so i can quickly react to the need for more or less power.

Today’s turns around a point and steep turns went much better. I am starting to gain proficiency in turns around a point, correcting for wind.


## Flight 2: September 19, 2020

### GROUND (Theory): 
Today, we mostly covered ground-reference maneuvers, and we also worked a bit on steep turns. 

#### Procedure for steep turns:

1. Clearing Turns, to make sure you’re clear of people, 1500 ft A.G.L, ID a landmark, establish approached level (90kts @2100rpm in a C172S)
2. Bank/ball to 30 deg, maintain crosshair
3. Upon passing 30 deg bank, pitch up, to maintain crosshair.
4. Throttle in 1 inch
5. Trim, one full half turn nose up (wheel goes from top to bottom ONCE)
6. Maintain crosshair through turn. Hold rudder in direction of turn. Neutral/opposite bank depending on wid.
7. To recover, Bank/Ball, Pitch, Power, Trim. Bank/ball opposite to roll in.

#### Ground-reference maneuvers (turns around a point, S-turn, rectangular track)

##### Turn around a point:

1. Clearing turns, 600-1000 feet agl
2. Enter perpendicular to pylon, ⅛ mi away. Go abeam downwind.
3. Adjust bank angle consistent with groundspeed ot maintain constant radius around pylon.
4. Use landmarks at each 1/4 turn to adjust bank angle
5. Articulate out loud required bank angle.

When DOWNWIND, W/TAILWIND, you are going FAST and need a STEEP bank angle
In CROSSWIND situations, you may need to CRAB. MEDIUM bank angle
In UPWIND conditions, HEADWIND, you are SLOW and need a SHALLOW bank angle.

##### S-Turn: 

Essentially two HALF turns around a point in different directions. First, Identify common reference line (roads are good) around which to fly two half turns. While on the line, choose landmarks to be your pylons

The actual steps are the same as for turning around a point.

##### Rectangular course:

A rectangular course is four quarter turns around a point, connected with segments between each corner. They create a rectangular course. The rectangular course is the same as the departure procedure as well as the approach for a landing. 
 
The actual steps are the same as for turning around a point. Additionally, with cross-winds, during legs, we need to crab into the wind to avoid drifting off course. This is true in the turns around an S and point, but there is more room to drift off, when we are going straight longer.

### PREFLIGHT:
Always keep official logbook AND backup notebook. In backup notebook, we can keep logbook info, plus notes, and also things ATC tells us in the air. Pre-flight notebook info:

Header at top of page, description of flight aand what we’re doing this time around. Then, top right corner: date & tail number.

- T.F.Rs: Use the website for short &/or local flights. Use phone call for XC planning.
- T.A.F: Write down relevant weather. Example:

    ```
    FROM SJC as of 1730Z
	  FM 220Z 301/11kt v6+ Few 2k
    ```
    
- AND METAR, but don’t need to write bc we will get data from ATIS before flying.
- Track start, end tach and hobbs time. Engine start, wheels Up, wheels Down, engine stop.

Example ATIS entry: 

```
PAO -I (Measurement location & time [alphabet letter for hour of day]). 2347Z
320/11
10SM vis
CLR skies
29.90 InHg
31 (density ?)
```

- Check NOTAMs for places you’re going. ATC will yell at you if you’re breaking the rules.

- To request taxi:

```
Palo Alto Ground, Cessna TAIL # at advantage, ready for taxi. With Indigo for a Left-downwind departure towards San Martin.
```
There are also other types of departures and so-on. Additionally, this request permission for taxi is PAO specific. We don't do that at other airports.

### IN FLIGHT / Debrief:

Planned to make a downwind departure left off the runway towards San Martin, where we would practice ground-reference maneuvers and possibly a touch and go landing. We did exactly that.

Today was about airmanship. Practicing turns, climbs, descents, etc. Not a lot of maneuvers where we have to configure the aircraft. A ton of trimming to make the airplane work with me. Today I learned a whole lot about how sensitive the aircraft is (especially w.r.t trim and pitch.). 

Overall notes:

- Be better about checking crosshair on the horizon
- The horizon is top of farthest visible mountain, if possible
- HOLD YOKE AND FEEL PRESSURE BEFORE TRIM.
- DO NOT fly plane with trim wheel
- Know where the horizon is.
- Think about L/R, Slip/Skid.
- During turns, pay attention to attitude.
- Having roads to follow is helpful, like flying over graph paper
- On circles & S-turns, I was too steep i the medium->shallow upwind sector. Overall I did rather well with circles and rectangles.
- Pitch change turing a turn changes ground speed, this messes everything up.
- On the way back i practiced slow flight ad did the descent into the landing.


## Flight 1: September 8, 2020

NOTE: this flight entry was made well after the flight occurred, so the formatting won't be perfect by any means.

### GROUND

Before flying:

- Restricted zones
- NOTAM & weather
- Check out plane

LOGBOOK ENTRY:
Logbook entry must contain: 

- Name
- Tail number
- Date/time (Zulu[UTC] and Local)
- Weather briefing (more info later)
- Hobbs time - start
- Tach time - start
- (fill in others, once you land)
- Time up and time down

### AIR / Theory:

#### Maneuvers:

##### Climb:

1. Pitch (Up, a bit above horizon)
2. Power (increase)
3. Trim (to release controle stick pressure)

##### Turns:

###### LEFT:

1. Bank  (aileron)
2. Rudder (not necessary for left)
3. PITCH constantly
4. Trim (if nec.) for long turns
5. Out with RIGHT RUDDER

###### RIGHT:

1. Ball (Left rudder)
2. Make sure not overbanking (60 deg feels like wheeeee)
3. Pitch constantly
4. OUT with AILERON and then RUDDER

##### DESCENT:

1. Opposite of CLIMB but more complicated. It's more complex beacause climbing is power-limited. Can descend in many ways.


### NOTES:

- Ground-level (taxi): Tend to go right due to extra braking on Right. Focus on extra left-side braking
- More right rudder, in general. THe plane really wants to go to the left.
- For left turns: aileron in, out with right rudder pedal. For right turns, in with rudder, out with aileron + rudder (in that order)
- Do better at keeping plane level through turns. Through a turn, continually check crosshair against horizon
