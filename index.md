# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 17, Deceber 20, 2020

I soloed. No further notes.

 ## Flight 16, December 19, 2020

 I had another day of "well you should have soloed, but...". Unfortunately, this time it was a thousand percent my own fault. I left my blue folder containing all of my flying paperwork at home, and because it included the 3rd class medical certificate, that meant I could not legally solo. It's a real shame too, as after a messy first two times around the pattern, I was totally ready to go. This entry will also be short, because I am exhausted.

### Flight

We started at a quick pace (in theory, to give me more solo time, sadface). When we walked out to the airplane, it wasn't there! After being confused for a minute, we walked to the maintenance hangar and found it, with a new door lock and a working hobbs meter (sad face). We did a quick pre-flight, and I made a new mistake. After noticing that the fuel gauges weren't quite true, I neglected the rest of the final walk-around and forgot to close the oil door. That was stupid. Luckily, it is pretty easy to fix.

Considering that I am getting close to (should have been done already) my first solo, today was an autonomy study. My autonomy is significantly better than it ever has been. I was able to handle the takeoff transition over to NorCal pretty well. Additionally, on takeoff, the PAO controllers asked us to do some things different from usual, and I dealt with that just fine. Andrew says I need to trust myself more, and that not thinking twice about everything I do will free up my brain to focus on other tasks.

During the cruise over, we practiced leaning the airplane, and GPS and VOR navigation using the GPS (duh) and the Salinas VOR. We headed over Lexington reservoir to the shoreline and then hung a left towards Watsonville. During this, I practiced calculating when to descend, in order to reach the 45 at TPA, 3 miles out. The calculation is as follows: $$(necessary loss of altitude) / (rate of descent) * (ground speed in kts/min) + 3 mi$$. Ground speed in kts/min, is just $$(ground speed in kts/hr / 60 (min/hr))$$. 

In the pattern at Watsonville, the first two times around were pretty rough. I definitely wouldn't have killed anyone if I'd done them alone, but they were pretty sloppy. After that, I did significantly better, and I'd even call some of them "good". I made a few common errors today, which I will outline here. I tended to be late on the flaps, or forget to do them entirely. I managed to mostly sort out this problem by the end of the day. I also tended to under-deploy flaps, as the detents are not properly calibrated in this airplane. I also tended to flare early, and then relax backpressure, which can lead to nosewheel hits. I actually had one nosewheel landing, but it was very very slight, luckily. I will chalk that up as a close call and not make that mistake again. 

After that, we headed over to San Martin, where we did two more trips around the pattern, plus one simulated emergency. During the simulated emergency, Andrew and I discussed how even if the airport has a right traffic pattern, in an emergency, we can still orbit to the left as it affords us better visibility. Once we declare an emergency, traffic will get out of our way. We finished the simulated engine failure with a power-off approach, which went pretty well. I managed to reach the runway and perform a normal landing. I need to remember that the orbits are essentially a very large turn around a point, and I need to do better at thinking about the required changes in bank angle to do so. There is still a lot of work to be done on the emergencies, but that was a good milestone. Finally, as we made two straight-in landings, we discussed the 3-2-1 1-2-3 rule. At 3 miles out, you should be at TPA and put flaps 10. At 2 miles out, flaps 20, and at 1 mile out, flaps 30. That yields a nice normal approach to land.  

There is good news, even though I would say I did significantly better last weekend. That is the following: My glide judgement is getting much better, as evidenced by the simulated engine failure. Even my sloppiest landings still wouldn't have damaged the airplane or killed anyone. My flare technique is getting better. And finally, I am usually able to correct my mistakes without any help.

## Flight 15: December 13, 2020

Had a really good (and really tiring) flight today, so excuse the short entry. We did 2.8 hours of flying, and 20 landings (!!). We started out by reviewing my pre-solo written exam (which is now done), and making sure I had the required documentation in order to solo when it is time.

Today was a dark and rainy day, so I wasn't sure we'd be able to fly at all. It turned out that even with the clouds and the rain, we were still well above VFR minimums for flight. Unfortunately, due to the terrain, we were unable to go to our normal south bay practice areas (either they were under IFR or the required routes there were), and instead we opted to go to Reid-Hillview. Because of both the weather and the fact that Reid-Hillview is new to me, I was unfortunately unable to solo today, but I am hoping to do so next week.

During the flight, I am gradually taking on more of the radio and navigation duties, and I am slowly starting to build up the ablility to do so while also flying the plane. I also committed a cardinal sin and took off without the mixture full rich, because I did not lean it aggressively enough on the ground, and so didn't notice when I went to apply the power. Because the weather was crappy, we mainly focused on pattern operations. We flew over the salt ponds and the Tesla plant on our way over to RHV.

Reid-Hillview is a good place to do patternwork for a number of reasons: there are two runways each with different traffic patterns (so we can practice both right and left traffic). Also, there is a 4-light PAPI which allows us to more precisely evaluate how we are doing. Finally, it's nice to practice somewhere with a tower.

For takeoffs, my new goal is to be more or less autonomous. I am getting there, but I know the answers to most of the questions I ask already, so I just need ot continue to convince myself I can handle it. I am getting better at the rectangular course, especially the upwind/departure leg. My shallow turns are significantly shallower than they were last time. I still need to continue to develop and practice on these things, but they are getting better. Additionally, about halfway through, I was looking at the instruments too much so Andrew covered them, after which my performance got significantly better. By the end of our practice, I was reliably able to get to TPA without looking at the instruments at all, and adjust the power by hearing the engine noise.

The mistake I am making most commonly is not holding the nose up during the turn from crosswind to downwind, and from departure to crosswind. Additionally, I am not as good at holding the nose up as much as it needs to be on the downwind leg itself. Other than that, the only major issue with the downwind leg is not being used to the required amounts of crab angle. When starting the descent, the flap extension is not always perfectly calibrated to the detents, which requires an extra step of thinking about the flap angles. That caused me to be late to start the descent, and so I sometimes ended up too high on final.

I was also late to apply flaps throughout the pattern. Usually, I try to deploy flaps during the various turns rather than after. Today I was sometimes a bit late. With the crosswinds we experienced today, I was frequently turning final too early, and thus ending up high on final, and having not so much time to sort out runway alignment. Also, we used a model 172N with a carburetor and the carb heat settings were new to me. 

The good news is that my glide judgement is getting significantly better, and my flare technique is as well. The landings themselves were mostly autonomous. About 10% of the time, I tend to flare a bit too high, but now I know that I can correct for that. I still need to make sure I cannot see the runway at all during the flare. During the rollout, I have a tendency to relax any necessary crosswind inputs, which I need to not do. Especially at Palo Alto, we had pretty solid crosswinds which necessitated a couple of one point landings. That was a new and exciting experience. I am slowly getting more comfortable with the Palo Alto traffic pattern.

## Flight 14: December 6, 2020
### Flight
Had another really good flight today. Two in a row in 4660G which it turns out is a pretty fun plane because of how light it is. It would be perfect if only they would fix the throttle, but that is unlikely. We did a little bit longer pre-flight because we were waiting for the cloud cover to burn off. In the morning, the airport was actually under IFR rules but the sun burned off the clouds pretty quickly, in fact, VFR was restored before we were even in the plane. During the pre-flight, we talked about the engine fire procedure. If the engine catches fire, the emergency descent is very different from any other engine-failure-induced emergency descent. In other forced descents, we fly at best glide speed in order to give ourselves as long as we can to try to restart the engine. When we have a fire, on the other hand, we want to get down on the ground quickly, and we want to attempt to use our airspeed to put out the fire. The steps are summarized:
```
Engine fire: try to land as quickly as possible.
A- Airspeed: Pitch to go fast enough to blow out the fire (at least 100 knots)
	- This will result in a descent of at least 1500 ft/min. That's fast.
	- When there's no more smoke, we can resume best glide speed and try to land slowly.
B - Best place to land: Same as usual. Find the best place to land.
C - Checklist. Turn everything off.
	- Use discretion and maybe decide to turn master back on briefly to call mayday
	- Most airplanes have a remote manual trigger for the ELT. If possible, trigger the ELT before you crash.
```
### Flight
The flight was really solid. We did a lot (navigation practice, patternwork, visited 4 airports, two simulated emergencies, and radio practice), and flew for about 3 hours. As soon as I hopped out of the plane I was about ready to collapse. Before the flight, we talked a little bit about the VFR flight rules, as the airport was under IFR conditions. I did a pretty good job with the initial take-off, but I overbanked on the upwind leg, and ended up rolling out of the turn in the wrong place. Overbanking on the upwind leg is a common mistake I tend to make. Definitely something to work on. On the way up, we talked about the clouds we were seeing and the clear-air turbulence associated with them.

Up next, we headed over to Watsonville, via Lexington. On the way, we practiced the EGT leaning procedure, GPS and VOR navigation, and talking to various controllers on the radio, as well as trimming and flying at the right altitudes and headings, using a combination of the instruments and the visual references I am learning. I am getting significantly better at trimming, but am generally a bit late to actually get the plane in trim, especially in the pattern. On the way over, we also did a simulated engine fire. That was pretty difficult. I didn't keep the airspeed up enough, which is understandable because of how disconcerting it is to be descending so fast.  We talked about spacing from the intended glide target and how that is something I need to work on. During the simulated fire, I was too close to the place I wanted to land while we were doing the final orbit, and because of that I overshot it.

After that, we did patternwork at Watsonville. Here are a collection of notes from all the patternwork, starting downwind abeam. On the downwind abeam legs, I tended to be a bit too close. I also tended to not be starting the descents soon enough. That leads to being high throughout the pattern, and that also means I end the descent too fast, which makes life more difficult. I also need to do a better job of keeping the power low. The throttle friction on 4660G is really a pain in the ass. The turns to base were mostly good. The biggest issue there is nnot quite turning to the right heading. I need to do better at choosing a landmark well before I need to actually make the turn, because otherwise, the wing gets in the way. On base, I tend to turn final too early and too shallow, which results in a non-rectangular rectangular course, which helps reinforce my bad habit of being too high on final. On fine, I need to be more proactive about dropping the power rather than staying at 1500 RPM for a long time and then pulling all the way to idle. The more stable and constant the descent, the better the landing will be. I also tend to star the flare a little high, and a few times I sort of hung-up the airplane. The good news here is I am getting better at correcting these mistakes that I am making and ending up with smooth landings anyways. Today, we had lighter crosswinds than we did last week. I generally did a pretty good job with them, but I need to do better at not drifting due to the wind during the roll-out. I tend to relax the aileron-into-the-wind input after landing, when I can really only relax that input after we reach taxi-speed and turn off the runway.

Up next, we flew over to San Martin, where we did a few more landings. That pattern was harder to work in because there was a very significant and gusty headwind. There was also a lot going on in the pattern with some parachutists and several other planes, and a thick layer of haze which made it hard to see. With the strong headwind, the VASI and the amount of power necessary sometimes don't add up. This is because you sometimes need to carry a lot more power in order to break the headwind. Also because of the headwind, the flare is a lot more effective. This meant that the appropriate amount of flare at Watsonville resulted in a major hang-up at San Martin. I am getting better at making the glide-judgement, which is to say, deciding when it is okay to fully reduce power and glide into the runway. Finally, we headed back to Palo Alto via Reid-Hillview airport, in San Jose, which is one of Andrew's favorite airports. On the way back, we did a second simulated engine failure, and I once again made my downwind spacing too close and would have overshot the landing spot. That said, I did much better than yesterday, when I would have killed us if the emergency was real. Looking forward to the next few weeks.


## Flight 13: December 5, 2020
### Preflight
After three weeks off, I expected to regress a bit, but interestingly, I didn't really regress at all. We had a great flight (3.0 hours, 15 landings, a simulated engine failure, some slow-flight and some stalls.). My memorization of some of the maneuvers has slipped a little bit, but other than that, I am making a lot of forward progress.
As expected, the next several flights will mostly have the same game plan: mostly patternwork, plus some maneuvers on the way to whatever airport I am at, with some ground work thrown in as necessary. Occasionally, new stuff will be introduced, but I am most of the way through the pre-solo training in terms of having seen stuff, but not in terms of experience. Today, we talked about the forward-slip, which is a maneuver we use to lose altitude by showing the prevailing wind more of the plaine in order to induce extra drag. The procedure for forward slip looks like this:
```
0. Position on final (presumably high, either to clear an obstacle or due to pilot error)
1. 
	- After determining wind, aileron into wind.
	- Full opposite rudder, adjust aileron to steer (unusual)
2. Pitch down, increase vertical speed
	- Maintain airspeed + 10kt max
	- Accept increase in vertical speed
3. Hold inputs until intercept desired slope
4. Relax inputs, re-establish approach speed 1.3VS0 +10/-5
```
For me, the forward slip will be used to correct for errors. In planes without flaps, the forward slip is necessary in order to lose altitude.
### Flight

We had a very solid flight. On the ground, we overprimed the plane, which meant it took a few tries to start up. We also noticed that we could smell some fuel upon startup. I found that a little concerning, but small fuel leaks and/or cracks in the fuel lines is just something that happens in old planes (and I was flying a 43 year old plane today). If it was significantly worse, we may have had to switch planes, but it wasn't too bad.
We also noticed a couple of other little things, like the heading indicator, weren't quite working. That plane is an old one and that comes with some benefits and some drawbacks. The price is a major benefit ($30/hr cheaper than any other plane), but the drawbacks are that it sort of lacks the creature comforts that other planes like 305RS have.

I did pretty well with the radio transition out of Palo Alto. I was given an altitude restriction (to keep me away from traffic) for the first time, which was a new experience. We found the traffic and the restriction was lifted, so we could continue to climb over the terrain towards the Monterrey Bay. 
On the way over, we did a simulated engine failure (which I kind of screwed up...) I did a good job of finding the best place to land (airport right under me). I still didn't really give myself very much time to look around. I also confused myself after spending too much time deciding which way to make traffic. I should have immediately started making left hand orbits over the runway. I also had a problem figuring out which direction the wind was coming from. I lost a lot of altitude while making not-so-important decisions during time where I should have been doing other things.

After that, we did some slow flight, which went pretty well, except I went out of the PTS for heading (I forgot how much extra right rudder is really necessary for slow flight.) We also determined that the stall horn cuts on at about 40kt in 4660G. Next, we did some stalls. The stalls went pretty well, but I need to better re-memorize the recovery. It's pitch for level, power full, flaps 20, VSI reversal, flaps 10, establish climb. We then did a turning stall, which was okay, but I need to pull up quicker in order to accomplish the stall in 90 degrees of turn.

After that stuff, we went on to Watsonville to work on pattern operations. All of that went quite well, overall. We worked on spacing in the pattern, flare technique, general autonomy in the pattern, and all the other landing things. I tended to be late to do the flaps at points. I am not sure why I do that. We also practiced discretion when dealing with other planes in the pattern. For example, we had to extend our downwind a couple of times in order to not go to close to other planes who were on extremely long base legs or final legs. We also practiced crosswind technique (the sideslip), as there were ~3 kt crosswinds. The biggest problems I had were looking too much at instruments and not climbing at the right airspeeds. I need to pitch up more than I was. Also, I need to trim for hands-off, even when doing something that won't take very long. This is because the more the hand is on the yoke, the more likely you are to screw up stable flight.
