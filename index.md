# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 22: January 31, 2021
Another flight from the same weekend. This one had mixed results. Some good things, some not so good. I honestly think once a week might work better for me, mentally speaking. Giving myself time to process the first flight before doing another one does more good than harm, I believe.
Like I said, some things went really well, and other things not so much. We spent quite a long time on the ground talking about short-field approaches (section describing all of this below, after the prose). After that, we did our weather brief, and set off towards Watsonville.
On the way over, we got the rare treat of working with Sam, who is by far the best air traffic controller in the Bay Area. We're big fans of his. He has a way of getting everyone exactly the information they need and he shares it all in exactly the right way. It was funny how obvious it was that he was good at his job.
After passing over the hills, we went North and West over some farmland, and practiced an emergency. I did an overall excellent job. I converted the airspeed we had left over from the cruise into 250 extra feet of altitude, remembered the ABCs, used the checklist, and was able to do the check-flow from memory. I also judged the winds correctly and had reasonably good glide judgement. I got the airplane down mostly on the "runway" I wanted to. We did our go-around and that was definitely my best yet simulated emergency. After that, we did another emergency on the way to Watsonville, over MBA, where we assumed our engine failed at 1500 ft, the top of the TPA window. So we only had time to do the securing checklist, which we did pretty well. However, I was a bit too close on the downwind spacing, and so was a bit high on final. It's better to err wide than narrow, because you can always turn base (and final) early, but it's hard to do the opposite.
Finally, we moved on to patternwork. I was feeling a bit behind the airplane the entire time. The patterns were a little non-symmetric, because there were healthy crosswinds aloft, and I wasn't able to correct for them as much as necessary. We ended up doing seven, a couple of which were demonstrations of short-field landings, and one of which was a power-off. I need to keep working on my energy management and specifically be more proactive about adding flaps as necessary. On some landings, I get too slow, and sometimes even hear the stall horn above ground effect. When this happens, I need to add a little power and pitch down. If possible, I should just keep the speed as it should be in the first place. 

### Discussion of short-field landing technique:

Before we do a short-field landing, we have to ask ourselves (or the instructor/examiner) four questions:
- Why is the landing short?
	- Are there obstacles which render the useful length of the runway shorter?
	- Or is the runway just short?
- Will we need to turn base early?
	- If there is a person with us, will they call our base?
- Where is the touchdown zone?
	- The PTS are that we have to touch down within 200 feet of the specified point.
- Do we retract the flaps during the roll-out?
	- Depends on a lot. If we’re doing it right, the flaps will only help us and not hurt us.
With those questions in mind, and answered, these are the steps we will follow:
0. Configure for 90kts or slower as usual. Pitch and trim for level.
	- If the TPA is lower than usual, we have to be closer than usual.
1. Perform a noral approach until turning base.
2. Turn base at or before being on a 45 degree angle with the base.
	- May beed to follow a different VASI based on the obstacle. Be prepared to see red/red as you will be “below” the intended VASI to touch down short.
3. By the time we are on final, we usually need 30 degrees of flaps./
	- We also probably will need to carry power down to the runway.
	- We need to ask ourselves if we need extra power to get to the runway.
	- If at any point we pull the power idle, we will need to pitch for the 1.3 speed. We want to be on the lower end of the v1.3+10-5 window.
	- If we turned at the right time, assuming we will clear the obstacle, we just pitch for the 1.3 speed.
	- We aim to clear the obstacle with 50 feet of space, if applicable.
4. On final, we adjust  our ground speed to match the target touchdown zone.
	- Hold the 1.3 speed until in ground effect
	- If we heart the stall horn, too slow.
	- Add power and pitch down for as necessary.
	- As we are ready to flare, check the vertical speed. Add power and pitch down to soften the descent if necessary.
5. When touching down, rotate into full-stall attidude.
	- Brake heavier than usual.
	- Make sure the power is fully pulled out.
	- If the airplane floats, there is too much airspeed.
	- Hold the full-stall attitude.
  
N.B. regarding Flaps:
The Cessna POH says to retract flaps during the roll-out. If you land with too much airspeed, this is necessary, because the airplane has a higher stall speed with no flaps. If the airplane was landed at the correct speed, the increased drag from the flaps will help us.

## Flight 21: January 30, 2021

First flight with Andrew in quite a while. Overall quite a good flight. The differences between Steve and Andrew are pretty funny. Each says the other is obsessively perfectionist, while in reality both of them are. Steve is significantly more perfectionist about the weather, while Andrew is about some other things.

From working with Steve and resulting conversations between the two of them, we worked out a couple of issues. First and foremost, the issue is confidence. It's just going to take some mental effort on my part in order to build up my confidence. We also talked about open loop/closed loop, and being able to relax such as not to rush myself.

With that in mind, we decided to head over to San Martin/South County to do some patternwork at an airport I haven't been to in a while, and do some maneuvering on the way there. We practiced slow flight and power-off stalls, and did an emergency. During the emergency, I orbited to the right instead of the left, and was too late on the flaps to actually be able to make the intended landing spot. I also went a little slower than best glide because I overdid the trim. Had I committed to flaps earlier,  we would have hit the intended field fine.

After that, we moved on to patternwork at San Martin. The pattern was much better, especially my rectangular course. Most of the approaches were quite stable, which I was happy with. The round outs were also pretty solid, but because I made power reductions early on some of them, I came down a little hard a couple of the times. Also, we did a lot of work on the roll-out and slow-down. I need quite a bit more practice with that, but everything is always safe, which is good.

More details after tomorrow, when we have another flight scheduled.

## Flight 20: January 24, 2020

Had another successful flight (third of three in a row with Steve). A cold front rolled in overnight, along with some rain in the early morning (had dried up before we did anything). We also saw some mountain wave on the radar imaging, which was pretty cool to see. We had low altitude stratus clouds (2000 ft ceiling) and some nimbuses higher up. Lots of mountain obscuration (couldn't see the ridges between PAO and Watsonville at all). 

## Flight

This weather would have been prohibitively bad for me to fly alone in, even if I had my license. Visibility was okay, but the cieling at 2000 ft is not great. We decided to go to KRHV, with the intention being patternwork. Headed that way after a straight-out from runway 13 at PAO, directly into Moffet's airspace. After staying off their runways, we passed over San Jose, and straight in to Reid Hillview.

On our way in, they were using Runways 13L/R. We expected to be entering downwind for 31, so we weren't really in the right place. The tower told us to turn base and final for 13, which caught us off guard. We ended up going around. I slightly fucked up the go-around, but caught myself quick enough that we didn't fall out of the sky and die. 

After one more landing, they had us do a full-stop, and let us do a 180 on the runway to flip the pattern around, with the pattern switching to right-traffic 31R/Left-traffic 31L. We did several landings on 31L, before the controller gave us a chance to try out 31R for a while. None of them were unsafe, and a couple of them were very good. It was reassuring to be able to actually relax while flying. My rectangular course felt much better than usual. Looking back on the track logs, they were indeed more symmetric than usual, but also there was some significant variation in width.

Steve says my biggest problem by far is confidence. If I had more confidence in the things I was doing, I would be able to make the right decisions more quickly most of the time. We also had a tailwind on short final quite a few times, which made our landings much longer than we expect them to be. We also talked about my tendency to overcontrol in the flare and round-out. As a strategy I will use a 1 degree discrete step to help me move towards a continuous process of arrest/round-out/flare. I was doing better about the closed loop this time. Looking forward to flying with Andrew and seeing what he has to say about my progress.

## Flight 19: January 16, 2020

Due to resource (airplane) scheduling constraints, we were only able to sneak in a quick flight this morning. Because of that, we abandoned the idea of going to Watsonville, and instead took our talents to Hayward (my first time flying there).

### Flight

This weekend's flight went significantly better than last week's, possibly just because last week I was a bit out of practice, while this week, I had only six days off. My roll-outs were all much much better than they were last week. Something I was thinking about was how to do the "whoa horsie" movement better. The way to do it is flare, put down the nose, then slow down with brake and pull up just a bit, in order to not yank the airplane back off the ground. Having had that on my mind the whole last week, i was better able to handle the airplane.

The Hayward pattern is a little strange - it's only 650 feet AGL. This means that instead of throttling back with the flaps abeam the numbers, we need to throttle back late, about as we enter the turn base. It also means we have to do everything a bit quicker. It was good to go somewhere new this time.

My biggest issue was the open feedback loop. The idea being when we do something, we wait for it to take effect, and then observe whether it achieved what we wanted it to. If it did, we don't need to take further action. If it didn't, we repeat the process. Just doing the procedure only gets us into the right ballpark. Another philosophical issue is the decisions about power reductions. Steve's methodology is to make only two power reductions (once for the initial descent, and then again after the runway is made, pull power to idle). Andrew's methodology is to fix the point where you make the flap changes and use power to micromanage the altitude on base/final. It's interesting to try it both ways.

Now, onto the mechanical issues. I tended to drop the right wing during the climb rather than applying a little bit of right rudder. Also (and 4660G has a worse tendency than others in this regard), I actually need to hold a lot of right rudder during the left turns through the pattern (especially the turn crosswind). I am still making the same mistake about trim (holding too much pressure, then letting go in order to test) that I usually do. Finally, I tend to not trust my trim setting on final and pull back, despite the fact that I need to be going a bit faster. Also, I need to do better at judging the turn-in point for turning final. During the round out and flare, I need to do a better job of studying the drift and correcting during the flare rather than after it. In general, I need to make smaller and gentler inputs regardless of what those inputs are. Finally, I just need to relax and slow down my brain. I can keep up with things enough that I really don't need to rush myself, if I could just relax.

## Flight 18: January 10, 2020

After the first-solo debacle and then a COVID scare (had a negative test, so I am mostly out of the woods), I ended up unfortunately taking three weeks off from flying. Honestly, I was a little apprehensive coming back into it today. Also, because of some scheduling issues, I flew with Steve Philipson again. I find that his style is almost equally conducive to learning as Andrew's, though it is very different.

### Flight

We had a pretty good flight. For a while, Steve and I exchanged stories and discussed the physics of various types of approaches-to-land, and doing a very detailed weather breif, including talking about various weather phenomena and mountain wave wind patterns, while waiting for the IFR weather to burn off. We also talked about some of the things that tend to happen in California in the winter, like various kinds of valley fog and marine layer and so on.

We did a pre-flight and took off for our usual left-downwind departure towards Watsonville. After our normal 1500 ft/90 kt sanity-check and call to NorCal, we headed towards the Lexington Reservoir. This time, there was not a particularly good gap between the top of the mountains and the bottom of the clouds. We decided to divert around the hills and flew in through the Coyote valley, passing abeam San Martin.

After taking a moment to go over the hills and clouds (which was pretty cool), we descended down into the pattern at Watsonville. All in all, we did twelve times around the pattern. Many of them were good. Several of them were not as good. I am making progress on combatting my "landing too flat" habit, and have a couple of strategies to help me do so. One issue is continuing to look straight ahead but using my peripheral vision. If I look slightly out the side of the window, I will feel more reasonable about not being able to see ahead of me. I will also be able to see my drift and sink rates more effectively. The second issue is being too abrupt with my control inputs. This is true everywhere from taxiing to flying to landing. Everything should be a small input followed by giving time for the input to take effect. This problem is what caused my porpoise when I was solo. I needed to flare more gently and slowly, and hold the input and let the airplane sink. This even extends to my trim technique. I should work on using as little control pressure as possible, with a goal of just a finger. All in all, it was a good way to get back used to flying again.
