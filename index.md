# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 13: December 5, 2020
### Preflight
After three weeks off, I expected to regress a bit, but interestingly, I didn't really regress at all. We had a great flight (3.0 hours, 15 landings, a simulated engine failure, some slow-flight and some stalls.). My memorization of some of the maneuvers has slipped a little bit, but other than that, I am making a lot of forward progress.
As expected, the next several flights will mostly have the same game plan: mostly patternwork, plus some maneuvers on the way to whatever airport I am at, with some ground work thrown in as necessary. Occasionally, new stuff will be introduced, but I am most of the way through the pre-solo training in terms of having seen stuff, but not in terms of experience. Today, we talked about the forward-slip, which is a maneuver we use to lose altitude by showing the prevailing wind more of the plaine in order to induce extra drag. The procedure for forward slip looks like this:
```
0. Position on final (presumably high, either to clear an obstacle or due to pilot error)
1. 
	- After determining wind, aileron into wind.
	- Full opposite rudder, adjust aileron to steer (unusual)
2. Pitch down, increase vertical speed
	- Maintain airspeed + 10kt max
	- Accept increase in vertical speed
3. Hold inputs until intercept desired slope
4. Relax inputs, re-establish approach speed 1.3VS0 +10/-5
```
For me, the forward slip will be used to correct for errors. In planes without flaps, the forward slip is necessary in order to lose altitude.
### Flight
We had a very solid flight. On the ground, we overprimed the plane, which meant it took a few tries to start up. We also noticed that we could smell some fuel upon startup. I found that a little concerning, but small fuel leaks and/or cracks in the fuel lines is just something that happens in old planes (and I was flying a 43 year old plane today). If it was significantly worse, we may have had to switch planes, but it wasn't too bad.
We also noticed a couple of other little things, like the heading indicator, weren't quite working. That plane is an old one and that comes with some benefits and some drawbacks. The price is a major benefit ($30/hr cheaper than any other plane), but the drawbacks are that it sort of lacks the creature comforts that other planes like 305RS have.
I did pretty well with the radio transition out of Palo Alto. I was given an altitude restriction (to keep me away from traffic) for the first time, which was a new experience. We found the traffic and the restriction was lifted, so we could continue to climb over the terrain towards the Monterrey Bay. 
On the way over, we did a simulated engine failure (which I kind of screwed up...) I did a good job of finding the best place to land (airport right under me). I still didn't really give myself very much time to look around. I also confused myself after spending too much time deciding which way to make traffic. I should have immediately started making left hand orbits over the runway. I also had a problem figuring out which direction the wind was coming from. I lost a lot of altitude while making not-so-important decisions during time where I should have been doing other things.
After that, we did some slow flight, which went pretty well, except I went out of the PTS for heading (I forgot how much extra right rudder is really necessary for slow flight.) We also determined that the stall horn cuts on at about 40kt in 4660G. Next, we did some stalls. The stalls went pretty well, but I need to better re-memorize the recovery. It's pitch for level, power full, flaps 20, VSI reversal, flaps 10, establish climb. We then did a turning stall, which was okay, but I need to pull up quicker in order to accomplish the stall in 90 degrees of turn.
After that stuff, we went on to Watsonville to work on pattern operations. All of that went quite well, overall. We worked on spacing in the pattern, flare technique, general autonomy in the pattern, and all the other landing things. I tended to be late to do the flaps at points. I am not sure why I do that. We also practiced discretion when dealing with other planes in the pattern. For example, we had to extend our downwind a couple of times in order to not go to close to other planes who were on extremely long base legs or final legs. We also practiced crosswind technique (the sideslip), as there were ~3 kt crosswinds. The biggest problems I had were looking too much at instruments and not climbing at the right airspeeds. I need to pitch up more than I was. Also, I need to trim for hands-off, even when doing something that won't take very long. This is because the more the hand is on the yoke, the more likely you are to screw up stable flight.
