# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## PPL Flight 18: January 10, 2020

After the first-solo debacle and then a COVID scare (had a negative test, so I am mostly out of the woods), I ended up unfortunately taking three weeks off from flying. Honestly, I was a little apprehensive coming back into it today. Also, because of some scheduling issues, I flew with Steve Philipson again. I find that his style is almost equally conducive to learning as Andrew's, though it is very different.

### Flight

We had a pretty good flight. For a while, Steve and I exchanged stories and discussed the physics of various types of approaches-to-land, and doing a very detailed weather breif, including talking about various weather phenomena and mountain wave wind patterns, while waiting for the IFR weather to burn off. We also talked about some of the things that tend to happen in California in the winter, like various kinds of valley fog and marine layer and so on.

We did a pre-flight and took off for our usual left-downwind departure towards Watsonville. After our normal 1500 ft/90 kt sanity-check and call to NorCal, we headed towards the Lexington Reservoir. This time, there was not a particularly good gap between the top of the mountains and the bottom of the clouds. We decided to divert around the hills and flew in through the Coyote valley, passing abeam San Martin.

After taking a moment to go over the hills and clouds (which was pretty cool), we descended down into the pattern at Watsonville. All in all, we did twelve times around the pattern. Many of them were good. Several of them were not as good. I am making progress on combatting my "landing too flat" habit, and have a couple of strategies to help me do so. One issue is continuing to look straight ahead but using my peripheral vision. If I look slightly out the side of the window, I will feel more reasonable about not being able to see ahead of me. I will also be able to see my drift and sink rates more effectively. The second issue is being too abrupt with my control inputs. This is true everywhere from taxiing to flying to landing. Everything should be a small input followed by giving time for the input to take effect. This problem is what caused my porpoise when I was solo. I needed to flare more gently and slowly, and hold the input and let the airplane sink. This even extends to my trim technique. I should work on using as little control pressure as possible, with a goal of just a finger. All in all, it was a good way to get back used to flying again.
