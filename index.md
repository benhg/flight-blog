# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)


## Flight 2: September 19, 2020

### GROUND (Theory): 
Today, we mostly covered ground-reference maneuvers, and we also worked a bit on steep turns. 

#### Procedure for steep turns:

1. Clearing Turns, to make sure you’re clear of people, 1500 ft A.G.L, ID a landmark, establish approached level (90kts @2100rpm in a C172S)
2. Bank/ball to 30 deg, maintain crosshair
3. Upon passing 30 deg bank, pitch up, to maintain crosshair.
4. Throttle in 1 inch
5. Trim, one full half turn nose up (wheel goes from top to bottom ONCE)
6. Maintain crosshair through turn. Hold rudder in direction of turn. Neutral/opposite bank depending on wid.
7. To recover, Bank/Ball, Pitch, Power, Trim. Bank/ball opposite to roll in.

#### Ground-reference maneuvers (turns around a point, S-turn, rectangular track)

##### Turn around a point:

1. Clearing turns, 600-1000 feet agl
2. Enter perpendicular to pylon, ⅛ mi away. Go abeam downwind.
3. Adjust bank angle consistent with groundspeed ot maintain constant radius around pylon.
4. Use landmarks at each 1/4 turn to adjust bank angle
5. Articulate out loud required bank angle.

When DOWNWIND, W/TAILWIND, you are going FAST and need a STEEP bank angle
In CROSSWIND situations, you may need to CRAB. MEDIUM bank angle
In UPWIND conditions, HEADWIND, you are SLOW and need a SHALLOW bank angle.

##### S-Turn: 

Essentially two HALF turns around a point in different directions. First, Identify common reference line (roads are good) around which to fly two half turns. While on the line, choose landmarks to be your pylons

The actual steps are the same as for turning around a point.

##### Rectangular course:

A rectangular course is four quarter turns around a point, connected with segments between each corner. They create a rectangular course. The rectangular course is the same as the departure procedure as well as the approach for a landing. 
 
The actual steps are the same as for turning around a point. Additionally, with cross-winds, during legs, we need to crab into the wind to avoid drifting off course. This is true in the turns around an S and point, but there is more room to drift off, when we are going straight longer.

### PREFLIGHT:
Always keep official logbook AND backup notebook. In backup notebook, we can keep logbook info, plus notes, and also things ATC tells us in the air. Pre-flight notebook info:

Header at top of page, description of flight aand what we’re doing this time around. Then, top right corner: date & tail number.

- T.F.Rs: Use the website for short &/or local flights. Use phone call for XC planning.
- T.A.F: Write down relevant weather. Example:

    ```
    FROM SJC as of 1730Z
	  FM 220Z 301/11kt v6+ Few 2k
    ```
    
- AND METAR, but don’t need to write bc we will get data from ATIS before flying.
- Track start, end tach and hobbs time. Engine start, wheels Up, wheels Down, engine stop.

Example ATIS entry: 

```
PAO -I (Measurement location & time [alphabet letter for hour of day]). 2347Z
320/11
10SM vis
CLR skies
29.90 InHg
31 (density ?)
```

- Check NOTAMs for places you’re going. ATC will yell at you if you’re breaking the rules.

- To request taxi:

```
Palo Alto Ground, Cessna TAIL # at advantage, ready for taxi. With Indigo for a Left-downwind departure towards San Martin.
```
There are also other types of departures and so-on. Additionally, this request permission for taxi is PAO specific. We don't do that at other airports.

### IN FLIGHT / Debrief:

Planned to make a downwind departure left off the runway towards San Martin, where we would practice ground-reference maneuvers and possibly a touch and go landing. We did exactly that.

Today was about airmanship. Practicing turns, climbs, descents, etc. Not a lot of maneuvers where we have to configure the aircraft. A ton of trimming to make the airplane work with me. Today I learned a whole lot about how sensitive the aircraft is (especially w.r.t trim and pitch.). 

Overall notes:

- Be better about checking crosshair on the horizon
- The horizon is top of farthest visible mountain, if possible
- HOLD YOKE AND FEEL PRESSURE BEFORE TRIM.
- DO NOT fly plane with trim wheel
- Know where the horizon is.
- Think about L/R, Slip/Skid.
- During turns, pay attention to attitude.
- Having roads to follow is helpful, like flying over graph paper
- On circles & S-turns, I was too steep i the medium->shallow upwind sector. Overall I did rather well with circles and rectangles.
- Pitch change turing a turn changes ground speed, this messes everything up.
- On the way back i practiced slow flight ad did the descent into the landing.


## Flight 1: September 8, 2020

NOTE: this flight entry was made well after the flight occurred, so the formatting won't be perfect by any means.

### GROUND

Before flying:

- Restricted zones
- NOTAM & weather
- Check out plane

LOGBOOK ENTRY:
Logbook entry must contain: 

- Name
- Tail number
- Date/time (Zulu[UTC] and Local)
- Weather briefing (more info later)
- Hobbs time - start
- Tach time - start
- (fill in others, once you land)
- Time up and time down

### AIR / Theory:

#### Maneuvers:

##### Climb:

1. Pitch (Up, a bit above horizon)
2. Power (increase)
3. Trim (to release controle stick pressure)

##### Turns:

###### LEFT:

1. Bank  (aileron)
2. Rudder (not necessary for left)
3. PITCH constantly
4. Trim (if nec.) for long turns
5. Out with RIGHT RUDDER

###### RIGHT:

1. Ball (Left rudder)
2. Make sure not overbanking (60 deg feels like wheeeee)
3. Pitch constantly
4. OUT with AILERON and then RUDDER

##### DESCENT:

1. Opposite of CLIMB but more complicated. It's more complex beacause climbing is power-limited. Can descend in many ways.


### NOTES:

- Ground-level (taxi): Tend to go right due to extra braking on Right. Focus on extra left-side braking
- More right rudder, in general. THe plane really wants to go to the left.
- For left turns: aileron in, out with right rudder pedal. For right turns, in with rudder, out with aileron + rudder (in that order)
- Do better at keeping plane level through turns. Through a turn, continually check crosshair against horizon
