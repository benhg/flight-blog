# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 37: June 19, 2021

Today was more back to normal lessons. It was good to actually be good at stuff again. Also, I was in theory going to be heading to Salinas on a solo cross-country tomorrow, and today was also partially about getting ready for that. Unfortunately, that airplane had the carb heat knob come off during someone else's checkride (what a terrible thing to have happen during a checkride) so that airplane is out of commission. No new maneuvers, just lots of work (we ended up logging 3.0 of time). Notes from today:

- Start: crack throttle (1 angstrom)
- Attitude instrument flying: mostly good
- Andrew put me in turbulence on purpose to simulate being in a cloud
- I got confused for a bit about the OSI radials, but eventually figured it out. I need to remember to just always make the heading indicator match the VOR indicator and I'll never have reverse sensing
- Got disoriented during the first unusual attitude, sort of froze a bit
- Second one was nose low, went fine
- Third one was nose high again and went better
- Remember, go back to 90 knots after recovery, don't keep power full
- Steep spiral was okay, but need to keep more left rudder, don't hold the turn with aileron
- Keep the 45 degree bank
- Power-off stall a bit nervous but otherwise good
- Needed some work on the power on stall, first one was rough and initially climbed. Need to pull up just to maintain altitude
- second one was better, but Andrew had to do too much coaching
- Third one was better as well, but more right rudder needed
- Need less instrument reference - it was happening because I just pulled the hood off but still
- Next was simulated engine failure
- On initial check flow, forgot fuel pump
- TPA ok, orbit OK, field selection ok, glide ok
- But I forgot the securing checklist and the radio calls
- Turns around a point, went fine mostly, was able to pick up on errors
- RHV pattern ops, did 5 left and 5 right
- Sinking on the straight in
- With high density altitude, need to keep power in longer than we expect
- Turning final early, need to square better
- Pulling power too early given heat
- Death drift started once
- During touch and goes, flaps 10 is ok, but don't do touch and goes solo
- Soft field - add power back while in ground effect to keep nose off, not earlier
- Pre-empt red/red VASI by adding power. Especially important with high density altitude
- First short field OK
- Second, kept power too long
- Third, turned final too early
- Make sure to be on it with SJC when doing the transition back to palo alto
- Cross SJC perpindicular to field
- Nose left of moffett or amphitheatre always
- Low at 3 mile mark to PAO (only by 100 ft)
- PAO had more headiwnd and was cooler, so needed more power
- But PAO also had less xwind than I was correcting for

## Flight 36: June 18, 2021

Today was really an exercise in kicking off the rust. Some things came right back, others not so much. 	In particular, what didn't come back is the flare. For me, the flare is more of a feel thing than a specific maneuver, so I got the timing all wrong, and then after the flare timing is upset (early), it becomes difficult to not bounce.

There's also a new maneuver we went over: the steep spiral.

The steep spiral is an emergency descent, where you need to get down on the ground as soon as possible. You may need to do this if you have some kind of issue with a passenger, where you just need to get them on the ground asap. The goal is to descend at a minimum of 1500 feet per minute.

Procedure:

0. Clear the area, 90 knots, 2000 rpm, at least 3500 ft AGL
1. Reduce power to idle
2. Sequentially extend full flaps in a nose level attitude, within the white arc, but faster than 1.3vs0
3. Roll left to 45 degrees bank (left should be preferred)
4. Pitch down to maintain less than or equal to VFE (top of white arc). You will get ~1500 ft per minute descent rate
5. Orbit as many times as possible. Before rolling out on desired altitude and heading.
6. Apply full power, retract flaps, stabilize airplane
7. Pitch/roll level at 90 knots

Debrief notes from the flight:
- Pre-flight, taxi, run-up, take-off were retained well
- Set #1 VOR/OBS to the number the GPS asks us to
- Attitude instrument flying went pretty well, set attitude indicator in the air, on ground it isn;t always quite level
- Clear traffic window when not using it
- Set the range to something useful both on traffic and map pages
- Compliment right rudder with aileron input
- AIF climbs are at 7.5 degrees
- Trim for a climb more promptly
- ATC/vectoring went ok, was realistic
- Intercept and track course was good
- Slow flight - we agreed on 45 knots even though the stall horn was misbehaving
- Reminder of pitch/power for airspeed/attitude in slow flight 
- When climbing, maintain airspeed and use power
- Look out the window
- Steep spiral - maintain 45 degrees bank
- Left rudder to hold the bank, not aileron
- Don't overspeed when descending
- Roll out is just like slow flight
- E16 patternwork: entry was good, altitude was ok
- Pattern was good, but landings needed work
- Flare was rusty - early and not enough every time
- Drifted a bit on downwind, need to crab more
- Back at PAO, patternwork was better, landings were better
- reminder of 3-2-1 rule, descend at 500 ft/min
- Too much sideslip for the small amount of crosswind present
