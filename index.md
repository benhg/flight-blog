# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Quick Solo: May 18, 2021

Not too much to say about this one. Took off from RHV and headed over through the east bay over to palo alto, before doing some patternwork there and heading back to RHV via the south bay and the SJC transition, where we make a downwind departure as if we are going to E16, then head over the anderson spillway and enter straight in to RHV. Was a good experience. Unfortunately, didn't have any time to do airwork along the way. Good experience though.

## Flight 34: May 15, 2021

Another good flight, lots of new things going on lately. This time, the big thing that's new is the beginning of my minimal private pilot instrument flight training. Basically, Andrew puts me behind "the hood" (which is  a pair of partially blurred out glasses), which simulates being stuck in IMC where you can't see out of the airplane. The method of flying we learn is called attitude instrument flying. There're a lot of very specific types of things you need to do with them. Some examples ofnum this are very specific rules about how to look at the instruments - these are called "scans", and sprcific types of clearances you need to enter IMC. That's all part of actual instrument rating training, which I'll do eventually at some point. But for now, I'm just learning the very very basics to use in case of an emergency.
 
Attitude-Instrument Flying (flight by reference to instruments):

Two concepts that are necessary:

- Primary/secondary
- Control/performance

The primary/secondary concept refers to the fact that each variable (bank, pitch, roll) can be measured by two instruments - a primary one and a secondary one. The primary one is one "where the needles don't move". For example, we can measure bank of the airplane, in straight and level flight, not with the attitude indicator, but instead with the heading indicator as the primary instrument. It will show a constant indication because there is not a turn active. A secondary instrument is either less precise or has a moving needle. We'll go through all of the situations in a minute.

Control/performance concept means we use pitch and power settings (control) to establish desired attitudes, and then evaluate our performance with by crosschecking the instruments.

There are 8 attitudes, each of which have specific scans associated with them and primary/secondary instruments for each. The attitudes are:

1. Straight & Level
2. Constant-rate descent
3. Constant airspeed-descent
4. Constant-airspeed climb
5. Standard rate turn
6. Constant rate descending turn
7. Steep turn
8. Climbing turn (constant-airspeed)

Let's go through the scans and attitudes:

#### Straight & Level Flight

- Primary instruments: Power: Airspeed Bank: Heading indicator Pitch: Altimeter
- Secondary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: TC, Attitude Indicator  Pitch: VSI

Scan: V-scan: ASI, HI, ALT

#### Constant-rate descent (straight ahead)

- Primary instruments: Power: Airspeed Bank: Heading indicator Pitch: VSI
- Secondary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: TC, Attitude Indicator,  Pitch: ALT

Scan: Slide-scan: ASI, HI, VSI

#### Constant-airspeed climb

- Primary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: Heading indicator, Pitch: Airspeed
- Secondary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: TC, Attitude Indicator,  Pitch: ALT, VSI

Scan: Diagonal scan: Tach, HI, ASI

Note: for this scan, after setting full power, omit the tachometer and switch to the mini-triangle scan of HI, ASI, AI

#### Standard Rate Turn

- Primary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: Turn Coordinator indicator, Pitch: Altimeter
- Secondary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: AI, HI,  Pitch: VSI

Scan: Check scan: ASI, TC, AI

#### Constant-Airspeed descent

- Primary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: heading indicator, Pitch: Airspeed indicator
- Secondary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: AI,  Pitch: VSI

Scan: Diagonal scan: Tach, HI, ASI

Note: for this scan, after setting and achieving desired power, omit the tachometer and switch to the mini-triangle scan of HI, ASI, AI

#### Constant-rate descending turn

- Primary instruments: Power: ASI, Bank: turn coordinator, Pitch: VSI
- Secondary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: AI,  Pitch: Altimeter

Scan: Parallelogram scan: ASI, TC, VSI

#### Constant-airspeed descending turn

- Primary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: turn coordinator, Pitch: ASI
- Secondary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: AI,  Pitch: Altimeter, VSI

Scan: Vertical scan: tach, TC, ASI

#### Steep turn

- Primary instruments: Power: ASI, Bank: AI, Pitch: ALT
- Secondary instruments: Power: Tach, Bank: TC,  Pitch: VSI

Scan: Flat scan: ASI, AI, ALT


Common errors with attitude instrument flying: Omission (skipping one or more instrument that is hard to understand) Fixation (fixating on one instrument which provides an incomplete picture) emphasis (similar to fixation)

Debrief from 5/15 notes: 

- Good job overall with AIF
- Plan to spend more time on recovery from unusual attitudes next week
- Straight-in entry to KRHV from the south, went well but I descended late
- Lot going on with the winds, they were kinda pushing me around at times
- Practiced patternwork at RHV on both runways, did lots of go-arounds so that we didn't have to wait in line after full-stops the whole time
- Be careful with runway alignment at RHV. Easy to accidentally drift into the upwind of the other runway, or the C airspace on the other side of 31L/13R
- Nose up more in descent
- Need more crosswind work
- More right rudder across the board
- Did some patternwork at palo alto, need to add power more promptly
- Did better with xwinds at PAO


## Back to normal (ish): May 8 2021

Had a great flight this Saturday. Not as exciting as previous weeks. Didn't solo anywhere. Didn't do anything particularly exciting. But also didn't make any horrible mistakes and did a pretty good job with a few things. I flew N66978, the airplane that is at KRHV. Reid-Hillview is nice in a lot of ways. All of the taxi procedure is more normal. And the pattern operations are more normal. And the wind is usually soft and down the runway. And it's usually less busy. 

We went over the route from Reid-Hillview to Salinas, so that in the future I can go PAO-SNS on a cross-country. That'll push me over my 5 hours solo cross country requirement. We also did a tonne of upper-air maneuvers and performance patternwork. First, we headed RHV to SNS, along the normal route: RHV -> Anderson reservoir -> GILRO -> SNS. Good practice for getting there autonomously. Then Andrew had me get into the pattern on my own, and I got turned around a bit before figuring it out and making the correct traffic pattern. A little bit of a snafu on the ground as I had forgotten to write down the ground frequency. I'll go through the AFD and add tabs on all of the airports I've been to. We did a few trips around the pattern there. We also took advantage of the opportunity to practice slow flight in the pattern. Then, we headed over to Watsonville to work on short field and soft field landings. Most of that went really well, better than I expected. The short-field ones especially. I did fine with obstacles and the touchdown zones both on all of the short field landings. But two things were unsatisfactory: the forward slip to land, and the upwind leg of the rectangular course (only on one of them). I let the wind get in my way, rather than making the airplane do what I wanted it to do. It's especially hard on short-field takeoffs where you climb out at VX. I'm not used to climbing out at VX and it feels really steep.

Then, we hopped over the hills and practiced steep turns. I did okay. They were passable, in terms of PTS, but I needed more right rudder in the right turn and the bank angle was less than constant in the left turn. There's a lot to focus on during the steep turns. I am sure I will be able to do okay as long as I work on them a bit when I'm soloing in the near future. We also did a little geography lesson at the end and I'll put those place names on the map later. After that, we did a simulated engine failure over E16, which I ended in a power-off approach. It was my best yet. A good landing and I did all the steps on the checklist. But I should have orbited wider. It would have bought me more time. Still happy with it though. Finally, we headed back to RHV and did more patternwork on both left and right runways, and practiced the ground taxiing and asking for runway clearances. It's good practice, especially because the FAA takes runway incursions extremely seriously. Looking forward to soloing that airplane more in the future. The last landing especially was really really good. Even Andrew admitted it was a greaser.

Various notes from Andrew:

- Practice with local landmarks at RHV
- Follow roads to Anderson, then GPS to GILRO, then VOR to SNS
- After GILRO, you will enter SNS on the 347 radial. Tune to the inverse of that to avoid reverse sensing. That's 167
- Babysit nav en route. Don't zigzag across intended radial
- Good work on the crosswind at Salinas.
- After clearing D airspace of an airport, it's ok to switch off frequency. This is more relevant at SNS than anywhere else, because there's so much C near all of the airports I usually fly at.
- When getting a clearance that involves crossing a runway or holding short, repeat the whole thing back. 
- If in doubt about crossing a runway, stop and ask.
- For short field takeoff, don't use brake to steer ever and use 10 degrees of flaps.
- Vx is steep. It feels weird.
- Steep turns: use the crosshair
- Power-off landing at E16 was good. But follow the traffic pattern that the airport has.
- Was late on the descent into RHV at the end
- More pitch level on the go around
- Trafic is distracting at times
- Don't correct for every gust. Let the airplane fly through the gusts.

## XC Weekend: Weekend of May 1

Andrew has a lot of things that he likes to do in specific ways. Over the years, he's honed his lesson plans into a series of things designed to expose you to certain situations you will experience in your flying career. Of course, everything is customized to the student's strengths and weaknesses, but a lot of things hold over from student to student. One of those things (and possibly the most important) is "XC weekend". It's not always a weekend but the weekend makes it convenient. Some of the part 61 requirements include "5 hours of solo cross country training, and a single cross country trip of at least 150 nmi or more, with 3 or more airports".

The plan is to knock almost all of this in one weekend. And, we go a bit out of our way to make it more productive. By that I mean the following. We could easily fly palo alto to salinas, salinas to marina, marina to san martin, and then back to palo alto, and have that count as the cross country. But that wouldn't actually teach cross country skills as much as going somewhere farther away does. There'd only be like 3 fixes on the navlog for crying out loud! So instead, we planned a trip to San Luis Obispo, which is 167 nmi away. There are a lot of fixes along the route, a restricted area to stay away from, and several ATC handoffs. So, you learn a lot. And, it felt like a real accomplishment, both solo and dual. From my memory, the route we travelled is: PAO->VPPRU->E16->SNS->LUCAB->BRALY->PRB->MQO->SBP. A real route. With lots of fixes, some of which are VORs and others of which are GPS intersections. It affords the ability to practice all kinds of stuff, like cross-radial navigation to find the change-over point of two VORs, and practicing switching frequencies. Calling flight service to file a flight plan. Opening and closing those flight plans in the air. Leaning the mixture really well. Trimming to go at 120 knots instead of 90. ANd all sorts of other things as well.

Anyways, we did all of that stuff in two days: first, on Saturday, we did it together, and also did some fun practice of diversions and navigation while in route. Andrew had me do a diversion to Paso Robles along the route without any warning, which was a good experience. I'm pretty happy with how it went. The winds were somewhere between hurricane force and "hellish" and I really had to try on some of the landings. The one at Paso Robles took me four tries because the wind was about 25 gusting 35 and the VASI was out. But once I got down I felt pretty accomplished. Then we hopped over to San Luis and ate lunch at the FBO while we got ready to go back to Palo. On the way out, we had to race away from some rapidly rolling in marine layer, before we practiced diversions again, this time to Hollister (but didn't land) and headed back to PAO where I stuck the crosswind landing as well as I ever have.

The next day, Andrew was doing the dual version with another student, so he was following me as I headed down to SBP by myself. The weather was vastly better. Clear and a million, with 15 knot winds right down all the runways I was using (except for palo alto in the evening). I headed down, descended out of the cruise into Paso Robles, did a full stop, and a 30 minute commute back (look at the A/F-D diagram for the Paso Robles airport if you want to see what I mean), and then hopped over to SBP. I waited for Andrew and his other student to join me for lunch, then headed back home towards Palo Alto. Not a cloud in the sky. But, there were about 6 knots of crosswind on the runway at PAO, which was a little hard to deal with. In the end, I did fine, and would consider it a successful (but expensive) weekend. All told, there were 9.7 hours of flying and who knows how much ground time.
