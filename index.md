# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 23
Short update today from a short (ish) flight. Met up at 9am, planning to head over to San Martin for some patternwork (which I've been doing a lot of). When we launched, wind seemed reasonable at E16:320/7kt. But when we launched, we found that winds had changed to 320/17g22. 17 gusting to 22 wasn't gonna work for us. It's a little weird for the wind to be picking up that early in the day, but it's okay. We diverted to Watsonville, going over the mountains. Spent a while in the pattern at Watsonville. My landings were mostly really good. A couple were flat, but all of them were really soft. Andrew asked if I wanted to solo, but I wasn't really feeling ready, so I didn't. In general though, the pattern needed work. I was constantly spending time correcting for mistakes I was making throughout the rectangular course, which makes it more difficult to actually do the things I needed to do. The most common mistakes I was making were 1- undershooting the turn to final, and then having to correct for that through the descent, and 2- diving the plane during turns base and final, instead of holding the nose up as is necessary. In any case, the real issue I am having right now is just one of confidence. I don't really know what's going on with that but I will have to figure it out. We spent some time in the pattern at Palo Alto on our way back, with some real crosswinds. Doing crosswind adjustment is always fun, and the first couple weren't so good. The last few ended up being solid though. Crosswind experience is just something i lack. Another problem I am having is looking at instruments too much. I might end up having to cover them entirely.
