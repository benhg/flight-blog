# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## XC Weekend: Weekend of May 1

Andrew has a lot of things that he likes to do in specific ways. Over the years, he's honed his lesson plans into a series of things designed to expose you to certain situations you will experience in your flying career. Of course, everything is customized to the student's strengths and weaknesses, but a lot of things hold over from student to student. One of those things (and possibly the most important) is "XC weekend". It's not always a weekend but the weekend makes it convenient. Some of the part 61 requirements include "5 hours of solo cross country training, and a single cross country trip of at least 150 nmi or more, with 3 or more airports".

The plan is to knock almost all of this in one weekend. And, we go a bit out of our way to make it more productive. By that I mean the following. We could easily fly palo alto to salinas, salinas to marina, marina to san martin, and then back to palo alto, and have that count as the cross country. But that wouldn't actually teach cross country skills as much as going somewhere farther away does. There'd only be like 3 fixes on the navlog for crying out loud! So instead, we planned a trip to San Luis Obispo, which is 167 nmi away. There are a lot of fixes along the route, a restricted area to stay away from, and several ATC handoffs. So, you learn a lot. And, it felt like a real accomplishment, both solo and dual. From my memory, the route we travelled is: PAO->VPPRU->E16->SNS->LUCAB->BRALY->PRB->MQO->SBP. A real route. With lots of fixes, some of which are VORs and others of which are GPS intersections. It affords the ability to practice all kinds of stuff, like cross-radial navigation to find the change-over point of two VORs, and practicing switching frequencies. Calling flight service to file a flight plan. Opening and closing those flight plans in the air. Leaning the mixture really well. Trimming to go at 120 knots instead of 90. ANd all sorts of other things as well.

Anyways, we did all of that stuff in two days: first, on Saturday, we did it together, and also did some fun practice of diversions and navigation while in route. Andrew had me do a diversion to Paso Robles along the route without any warning, which was a good experience. I'm pretty happy with how it went. The winds were somewhere between hurricane force and "hellish" and I really had to try on some of the landings. The one at Paso Robles took me four tries because the wind was about 25 gusting 35 and the VASI was out. But once I got down I felt pretty accomplished. Then we hopped over to San Luis and ate lunch at the FBO while we got ready to go back to Palo. On the way out, we had to race away from some rapidly rolling in marine layer, before we practiced diversions again, this time to Hollister (but didn't land) and headed back to PAO where I stuck the crosswind landing as well as I ever have.

The next day, Andrew was doing the dual version with another student, so he was following me as I headed down to SBP by myself. The weather was vastly better. Clear and a million, with 15 knot winds right down all the runways I was using (except for palo alto in the evening). I headed down, descended out of the cruise into Paso Robles, did a full stop, and a 30 minute commute back (look at the A/F-D diagram for the Paso Robles airport if you want to see what I mean), and then hopped over to SBP. I waited for Andrew and his other student to join me for lunch, then headed back home towards Palo Alto. Not a cloud in the sky. But, there were about 6 knots of crosswind on the runway at PAO, which was a little hard to deal with. In the end, I did fine, and would consider it a successful (but expensive) weekend. All told, there were 9.7 hours of flying and who knows how much ground time.
