# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

## Flight 4: September 27, 2020

### Ground, Pre-flight

Went over notes from yesterday’s flight (CFI and I were both super tired so we did a very minimal debrief last night. Filled in from notes today. This portion of today’s notes have been backported into yesterday’s entry.)

We talked about the power-off stall, why we need to do it, what we are going to do. That is summarized below:

0. Configure plane for slow flight (up to the reintroduction of power) As a reminder, here are the steps:
    1. Power to 1500
    2. Flaps to 10 degrees
    3. Pitch for level
    4. Flaps to 20
    5. Pitch for level
    6. Flaps to full
    7. Pitch for level
1. Now, pull the plane up to start to induce a stall
2. Get to 1.3Vs0, move power to idle (900 RPM)
3. Carefully pull plane up to stall attitude
	Stall attitude is whatever attitude we need to stall (depends on a ton of things)
4. May have to correct pitch with ailerons (gently)
5. At top of maneuver, we experience airflow separation. This is where we feel the stall happen
6. Airplane drops the nose. If we want to recover, we just let the nose drop, and release the backpressure. Then, we go full throttle, and climb out (will touch on recovery later)
7. If we don’t want to recover, and instead want to do the “falling leaf” maneuver, we just hold the plane at the edge of stall, and let it oscillate.
8. Now, here are the details for recovery.
9. Release backpressure and let plane nose fall
10. Promptly but smoothly go to full throttle
11. Aggressively pitch up for a climb
12. Sequentially release flaps, first to 20 degrees, then 10
13. Climb with flaps at 10 degrees.
14. Retract flaps fully when we level off, at a safe altitude.

### Pre-flight
I did most of the pre-flight inspection myself! I am starting to gain confidence with the pre-flight procedure. We spotted a bunch of flat spots on the tyres, and had to go back inside to squawk it. We also needed fuel, and were stuck at the mercy of the fuel truck for quite some time, about 45 minutes. While we waited, we talked about the operating manual, certification process, MFD and radio operation, and did a practice weight and balance calculation, on paper. Once we finally had our fuel, we started up and I taxied away to the run-up area, after asking for permission. Apparently, this is something we only do at PAO, most airports will let you go to the run up area just whenever. Today, I also remembered to hit “record” on ForeFlight before our take off, so I can look at the flight log to evaluate my performance afterwards. The ForeFlight log stopped recording in the middle of the flight, so i have about 2/3rds of the history It’s available here (https://www.foreflight.com/s/track/1601237172-5DEBE476-64C3-4EA0-AF06-0E38C6741518/). We waited in the run-up area for another half an hour or so. There was a whole lot of traffic coming in and out of KPAO, and we had to wait for both.

### In-Flight
 After about 0.5 hobbs-hours of time, we finally got clearance for take-off. Andrew helped me out because we wanted to go fast to allow traffic behind us to continue what they were doing. We took off with a left-dumbarton departure and climbed to 2500 ft, before heading north towards half-moon bay. On the way out there, we got a bit of turbulence coming off the mountains, and requested permission into climb above it. We received said permission and climbed up into a layer of smoke and haze, but no turbulence. Up there, we practiced steep turns, slow flight, and power-out stalls. Power off stalls were a bit scary the first time, but honestly kind of fun. After that, we had to book it back to PAO because the plane had a reservation right after ours. Did a quick landing, taxi and postflight. 

### Post-flight debrief:

If I could only choose one thing from this post-flight, it would have to be “keep your damn hand on the throttle.” I absolutely need to keep the hand on the throttle, especially during maneuvers which require throttle changes throughout. Even when I don’t do such maneuvers, though, I still need to keep the hand there so that I can change the power setting without delay when I need to do so. 

I also need to get better at dealing with turbulence. I am not used to experiencing turbulence in a light aircraft and so I need to be better at just trusting the airplane. Essentially, we were getting non-laminar wind off of the mountains, and it was shaking the plane a bit. Nothing to worry about, but it felt like we were shaking. 

When I do steep turns, I need to be more prompt with the throttle and more precise with trim, so that I can un-trim the plane when I’m done with the maneuver. Also, in the midst of turns, I should not look at the gauges. I should be looking at the horizon, and paying attention to where I’m going. Additionally, I don’t need to look at the throttle, just move it in an inch. Additionally, when I’m in the turn, I need to keep my head in the same place rather than moving over to the left or right. Moving changes my frame of view, and I lose reference to the horizon. This results in inadvertent climbs or dives. At one point I was climbing 300 feet through the course of a 360 degree turn. That’s not ideal (or permissible).

I’m also hesitant to go to the full 45 degrees of bank. I just need to do it when I want to. The crosshair needs to stay in the right place along the horizon. I can also use the glare-shield to measure the angle rather than anything else, because it is close to the windshield and allows me to see outside too. Another thing to remember is that if I screw up a maneuver, I should just stop the maneuver, recalibrate, and try again. 

From today’s slow flight, I need to be better about keeping the crosshair at or above the horizon. I waited too long to deploy flaps. I need to be more prompt about both 10 degree flaps, 20 degree flaps, and full flaps. They all have to be done by the time i hit 1.3Vs0, which is about 65 kts in a C172. I also have to do more right-rudder all the time in slow flight. When the plane weather-vanes with the wind in slow-flight, I correct with opposite-aileron. When turning in slow flight, I need to put the nose down to keep airspeed and add power to keep altitude. That is understandable because slow-flight is in the reverse-command region, so power is controlled by altitude while airspeed is controlled by pitch. Additionally, I should bank as shallow as possible, then add power, and bank more after power is added.

In general, I also need to be smoother with the throttle. In turns, I shouldn't come off of the rudder until the turn is complete. In the power-off stall, I need to be better about putting the mark on the horizon before being ready to stall. Today, because of the haze, the horizon wasn’t clear. I will build intuition about that. Additionally, I need to remember to take the flaps off after level-off, and it’s okay to climb with 10 degrees of flaps deployed. 

Final overall notes: I have a tendency to over-control the airplane. I need to let the plane fly through gusts and turbulence. Andrew likened it to a car going over a speed bump. If you steer the car while going over the bump, you make the bumping tendencies worse. Also, I look at the instruments too much. I need to focus more on the plane and the horizon. 


## Flight 3: September 26, 2020

### GROUND: 
Went over notes, mostly. Talked about takeoffs, steep turns, more on ground reference maneuvers. Talked about specific takeoffs at PAO - gotta go 10 deg to the right, noise abatement reasons.

Main departures: Left-downwind (make a 180 after t.o.), Left dumbarton (make left and follow bridge (after going tendeg right)), right dumbarton (same thing but make a right turn)

Approaches, basically they will tell us what to do. Either NorCal or PAO.


### AIR:
We took a left-downwind departure, towards San Martin. Flew over to san martin at ~1500 feet, rising to 2500. Take-off was a bit rough. I wasn’t so good with the throttle, especially. Also, need to remember to use the friction lock. After takeoff, we flew through SJC’s airspace around to san martin. On the way there, we practiced slow flight a couple of times, and the recovery.

After we got there, we practiced rectangular course, did a touch and go, and finally took off again followed by some ground reference maneuvers. Did a whole bunch of circles, a couple of s-turns. Was quite a gusty day. Winds ~25 kts with gusts in odd directions. Part of that is that it was afternoon. 

Had a lot of trouble finding the right trim today. Not super sure why. Additionally, I felt that i was a bit worse than last week on holding level through maneuvers.

After that, we practiced some steep turns (where there’s a lot going on.) We also practived slow flight again, before really booking it back as the sun was going down. Went over moffet field (whhere we noticed that radio was cutting in and out.) Eventually, moffet handed us off. Noted that KPAO tower was already closed, so we would be landing as if it was a non-towered airport. Did so, with some minor confusion. Moffet told us there was traffic. We did a left-360 to let them go by, moffet informed us they were. at 600 feet and on final. On our approach, we didn’t see anyone. Noticed that there was another plane who was taxiing away from runway. After landing, we saw another plane land just behind us. He had to do a go-around due to the plane we had seen taxiing away.  Little bit of a near miss not helped by the fact that not very much was coming through on the radio.

### Ground, Post-Flight (Backported from tomorrow):

Today’s headset was really irritating. Mic kept flying away from my face so Andrew couldn’t hear me. Additionally, volume was imbalanced and louder in the left ear. Headset had only one volume knob. 

Andrew and I had both noted that the plane was pushing me around all the time. I need to be a little more assertive with the plane at times. Especially on pitch, I need to really tell the plane what I want it to do. I’m definitely not going to break the plane, and I’m not going to drop it out of the sky. Plus, Andrew won’t let me get even close to that.

Additionally, I need to start to internalize the phrase “Aviate, Navigate, Communicate (in that order)”. During take off (which was my first take off) I was a little too concerned with what ATC was saying and not focusing enough on flying the darn plane. 

Another few small notes. Power changes need to be more prompt, and I need to get better about what “without delay” means. When making turns, I need to choose landmarks which are further away from me. That way, I will have a better frame of reference for what a turn’s arc-length is.

I practiced slow-flight a few times, and need to think about some things. The airplane tended to overpower me during slow flight. I noticed I need to use a whole lot more control surface in slow flight, especially right rudder. I also need to be much more aggressive about pitching for level flight, and how that’s different in slow-flight. Also, when I turn, especially in slow flight, I need to be more aggressive about pitching the plane to not gain or lose altitude. 

In general, the deeper the rudder, the more I need to put on opposite aileron to deal with airplane’s overbanking tendencies. In turns, sometimes, especially in slow-flight, I need to add power to maintain altitude. I also need to remember how the reverse-command region works, and how to control altitude with power and airspeed with pitch.

In slow flight recovery, I need to do a couple of things better. First of all, I need to apply flaps more precisely. Additionally, I tend to drop my hand off the throttle. My nhand needs to live on the throttle. I also add too much friction on the friction lock. It needs to be ¼ turn away at all times, so i can quickly react to the need for more or less power.

Today’s turns around a point and steep turns went much better. I am starting to gain proficiency in turns around a point, correcting for wind.


## Flight 2: September 19, 2020

### GROUND (Theory): 
Today, we mostly covered ground-reference maneuvers, and we also worked a bit on steep turns. 

#### Procedure for steep turns:

1. Clearing Turns, to make sure you’re clear of people, 1500 ft A.G.L, ID a landmark, establish approached level (90kts @2100rpm in a C172S)
2. Bank/ball to 30 deg, maintain crosshair
3. Upon passing 30 deg bank, pitch up, to maintain crosshair.
4. Throttle in 1 inch
5. Trim, one full half turn nose up (wheel goes from top to bottom ONCE)
6. Maintain crosshair through turn. Hold rudder in direction of turn. Neutral/opposite bank depending on wid.
7. To recover, Bank/Ball, Pitch, Power, Trim. Bank/ball opposite to roll in.

#### Ground-reference maneuvers (turns around a point, S-turn, rectangular track)

##### Turn around a point:

1. Clearing turns, 600-1000 feet agl
2. Enter perpendicular to pylon, ⅛ mi away. Go abeam downwind.
3. Adjust bank angle consistent with groundspeed ot maintain constant radius around pylon.
4. Use landmarks at each 1/4 turn to adjust bank angle
5. Articulate out loud required bank angle.

When DOWNWIND, W/TAILWIND, you are going FAST and need a STEEP bank angle
In CROSSWIND situations, you may need to CRAB. MEDIUM bank angle
In UPWIND conditions, HEADWIND, you are SLOW and need a SHALLOW bank angle.

##### S-Turn: 

Essentially two HALF turns around a point in different directions. First, Identify common reference line (roads are good) around which to fly two half turns. While on the line, choose landmarks to be your pylons

The actual steps are the same as for turning around a point.

##### Rectangular course:

A rectangular course is four quarter turns around a point, connected with segments between each corner. They create a rectangular course. The rectangular course is the same as the departure procedure as well as the approach for a landing. 
 
The actual steps are the same as for turning around a point. Additionally, with cross-winds, during legs, we need to crab into the wind to avoid drifting off course. This is true in the turns around an S and point, but there is more room to drift off, when we are going straight longer.

### PREFLIGHT:
Always keep official logbook AND backup notebook. In backup notebook, we can keep logbook info, plus notes, and also things ATC tells us in the air. Pre-flight notebook info:

Header at top of page, description of flight aand what we’re doing this time around. Then, top right corner: date & tail number.

- T.F.Rs: Use the website for short &/or local flights. Use phone call for XC planning.
- T.A.F: Write down relevant weather. Example:

    ```
    FROM SJC as of 1730Z
	  FM 220Z 301/11kt v6+ Few 2k
    ```
    
- AND METAR, but don’t need to write bc we will get data from ATIS before flying.
- Track start, end tach and hobbs time. Engine start, wheels Up, wheels Down, engine stop.

Example ATIS entry: 

```
PAO -I (Measurement location & time [alphabet letter for hour of day]). 2347Z
320/11
10SM vis
CLR skies
29.90 InHg
31 (density ?)
```

- Check NOTAMs for places you’re going. ATC will yell at you if you’re breaking the rules.

- To request taxi:

```
Palo Alto Ground, Cessna TAIL # at advantage, ready for taxi. With Indigo for a Left-downwind departure towards San Martin.
```
There are also other types of departures and so-on. Additionally, this request permission for taxi is PAO specific. We don't do that at other airports.

### IN FLIGHT / Debrief:

Planned to make a downwind departure left off the runway towards San Martin, where we would practice ground-reference maneuvers and possibly a touch and go landing. We did exactly that.

Today was about airmanship. Practicing turns, climbs, descents, etc. Not a lot of maneuvers where we have to configure the aircraft. A ton of trimming to make the airplane work with me. Today I learned a whole lot about how sensitive the aircraft is (especially w.r.t trim and pitch.). 

Overall notes:

- Be better about checking crosshair on the horizon
- The horizon is top of farthest visible mountain, if possible
- HOLD YOKE AND FEEL PRESSURE BEFORE TRIM.
- DO NOT fly plane with trim wheel
- Know where the horizon is.
- Think about L/R, Slip/Skid.
- During turns, pay attention to attitude.
- Having roads to follow is helpful, like flying over graph paper
- On circles & S-turns, I was too steep i the medium->shallow upwind sector. Overall I did rather well with circles and rectangles.
- Pitch change turing a turn changes ground speed, this messes everything up.
- On the way back i practiced slow flight ad did the descent into the landing.


## Flight 1: September 8, 2020

NOTE: this flight entry was made well after the flight occurred, so the formatting won't be perfect by any means.

### GROUND

Before flying:

- Restricted zones
- NOTAM & weather
- Check out plane

LOGBOOK ENTRY:
Logbook entry must contain: 

- Name
- Tail number
- Date/time (Zulu[UTC] and Local)
- Weather briefing (more info later)
- Hobbs time - start
- Tach time - start
- (fill in others, once you land)
- Time up and time down

### AIR / Theory:

#### Maneuvers:

##### Climb:

1. Pitch (Up, a bit above horizon)
2. Power (increase)
3. Trim (to release controle stick pressure)

##### Turns:

###### LEFT:

1. Bank  (aileron)
2. Rudder (not necessary for left)
3. PITCH constantly
4. Trim (if nec.) for long turns
5. Out with RIGHT RUDDER

###### RIGHT:

1. Ball (Left rudder)
2. Make sure not overbanking (60 deg feels like wheeeee)
3. Pitch constantly
4. OUT with AILERON and then RUDDER

##### DESCENT:

1. Opposite of CLIMB but more complicated. It's more complex beacause climbing is power-limited. Can descend in many ways.


### NOTES:

- Ground-level (taxi): Tend to go right due to extra braking on Right. Focus on extra left-side braking
- More right rudder, in general. THe plane really wants to go to the left.
- For left turns: aileron in, out with right rudder pedal. For right turns, in with rudder, out with aileron + rudder (in that order)
- Do better at keeping plane level through turns. Through a turn, continually check crosshair against horizon
