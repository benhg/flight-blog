# Ben's Flight Blog

To keep myself honest, I've decided to keep my personal notes from each flight I take in a blog, which everyone can see. Hopefully, this will get me in the habit of writing something up every time I take the air. It will also let me share some of the things I learn and formalize my process. Finally, it will serve as the fourth copy of all of my flight info (Behind my official logbook, my in-flight notebook, and ForeFlight on my iPad.)

At the end of each month, entries for that month will be moved to a new page for that month's archive. This is just to keep each page a reasonable size.

## Flight 11: 11/5/2020

### Pre-flight

Short pre-flight entry today. We talked about a few things and then went off to E16 (san martin) to do patternwork. Specifically, first, we talked about how and when one might want to do a go-around. You may want to do a go-around for many reasons, including a deer on the runway, someone moving onto the rinway for a takeoff, being unable to correct for a crosswind, etc. To do a go-around, it's a lot like recovering from a power-off stall.
```
1. Apply full power
2. Flaps 20
3. Look for VSI reversal
4. Flaps 10
5. Pitch for climb
6. Level off at TPA. Enter the pattern. Retract flaps to 0.
```
Lastly, we talked about radio communication in the pattern. The format of a radio message in the pattern at a non-towered airport is:
```
Airport Name
Airplane type & tail number
Where you are (incl. altitude if joining 45)
Pattern step you're in
Whether you are staying in pattern or not
Intentions (if abeam, base, or final)
Airport name
```
For example:
```
San Martin Trafic
Cessna 305RS
Wing up, turning base
Right Closed Traffic
Touch and Go, 32
San Martin
```
describes a Cessna entering the base leg for a touch and go, while
```
San Martin Traffic
Cessna 305RS
On the Upwind
Leaving the pattern
Straight out departure 32
San Martin
```
is what you would say when you make a straight-out departure from the traffic pattern.

With that in mind, the goal of today's lesson was to be as autonomous as possible, through as much of the flight as possible.

### Flight

We had an expedited startup, because there were people in a Cirrus waiting behind us. Andrew jumped in because I am still a bit slow to start up the plane. I am not ashamed of this - it's significantly more important to get things like this right than it is to get them fast. But anyways, Andrew needed to do the beginning of the taxi before I took over and did the run-up. I did significantly better on the take-off than last time. I made the right turns at the right altitudes, and even handled the radio communication while that was happening. I still leveled off at 1600 feet instead of 1500. I need to work on getting more precise with leveling off, as this would be a theme throughout some of the pattern work later on. We practiced cruising at a high power setting on the way over to San Martin, and I practiced my trim technique. Trim gets more sensitive as you go faster, and I need to be more subtle about trim at high power settings. There was a lot of haze which made it occasionally difficult to stay level, but there was plenty of horizon so that's not really a valid excuse. 

On the way over, we practiced slow flight and a power-off stall. The slow flight was fine, but I need to be quicker about adding power as soon as we reach the 1.3VS0 speed, because otherwise I will lose altitude. Also, I need to keep the pitch down a little further than I did to stay away from the stall horn. The entry to the stall was pretty good. However, I am still busting the maneuver on the exit by not putting in enough right rudder as the nose drops. This is something I have been doing wrong for quite a long time now. 

Next, we moved on to pattern work. We did a total of 12 landings, and I didn't have to refresh my memory with any high-speed taxis today, which was a good sign. After the first one, we did a full-stop and taxi back, to get me focused. After that, I took off with the mixture lean. The FAA does not like that idea, and it's why we lean so aggressively any time we are on the ground, so that if we try to take off lean, the engine will simply not do it as it won't have any fuel to burn. This way, we can make a mistake and not have the FAA throw the book at us (the AF/D is a heavy piece of paper I dont want thrown at me).  When we stop before doing a take off, we do a M/HALTTT check. That check consists of:
```
Mixture
Heading Indicator
Altimeter
Lights
Turn-around Altitude
Trim
Tsomething that starts with T which I will remember
```
At San Martin, there is a 10 degree noise abatement turn that I sometimes didn't quite complete as much as I should have. In general, I can read about noise abatement in the AF/D. Additionally, the crosswind leg is longer at E16 than WVI because of this noise abatement turn - we are spending some of the upwind going the other direction. Going around the rectangular course, there was marked improvement from last week, but still a lot of practice needed. We widened out the downwind leg to give us some more time on base to think and descend, and I was generally ending up high on final rather than low. My communication work was apparently solid. Andrew took over a couple of times when I got too busy to focus on it. In general, we turn base at about 800 feet AGL, wherever that happens to be. At E16, it happens to coincide with being near one of the overpasses. I was sometimes drifting right on the downwind leg, which then uses up some of the base leg which otherwise needs to be used for descending. During the turns, I sometimes let the nose come back up. I need to keep the attitude for the descent through the turn. After turning final, I tended to be high. When I end up high but the power is already idle, I need to pitch for the 1.3 speed and abandon the VASI. If the power is on, I can aim for the VASI. I need to be significantly smoother at breaking the glide, and also I was breaking the glide too early. Both the power adjustments and the flare on final need to be done smoothly and gently. At first, I was doing power right but too harsh with the yoke. Later, I was doing the pitch right but too aggressive with the power. A few times I got it totally right. Also, during the flare, I need to be better about making it a smooth transition from breaking the glide into the flare. I shouldn't let go of the backpressure at any point during that process. Finally, I need to make sure I am pitching up to the point that I cannot see the runway, or else I am doing it wrong.

After 10 loops around the traffic pattern, we headed back to PAO. On the way back, we got a special treat. I got to do a touch and go at SJC international, on the 12000 foot long runway. We were allowed to do a straight-in touch and go, which meant that it was the best landing of the day. It's also cool to say I've done a landing at a class-C airport. Overall a good flight. Looking forward to continually improving at the pattern work.


## Ground Instruction: 10/3/2020

We talked about maps, charts, and the chart supplement (AF/D). It was election night. Some day I will make a full entry about such things. It will require a lot of pictures so i'm not doing it now.
