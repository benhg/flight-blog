## Flight 29: March 27, 2020
Something quite different from usual today. Had a friend in town, so I decided to invite him along for the flight and we went on a bay tour, up the peninsula along the highway 101, then around the city of San Francisco, and back around the other side along the coast, along with a stop in Half-Moon Bay for some landings practice, and (spoiler alert) a short little solo.

Not a tremendous amount to say about this one, as most of it was just flying the airplane, which is starting to get easier for me. I did a pretty good job of trimming the airplane to hold altitude and be hands-off. Also, my radio communication is getting better, which is good. We went through the SFO class B airspace, which was cool and interesting to do. I am not yet ready to do that on my own, regardless of whether I would be legally allowed to or not (I would not). It was very cool to fly around the city, close to the buildings in fact, and got some good pictures. Eventually, I'll come through and add in some pictures from that flight here.

Later on, we headed around the peninsula and went back south along the coastline. When we got to half-moon bay, Andrew said something like "how about we do a couple of landings here"? I agreed and we did about three or four laps around the pattern. After that, we did a full-stop and Andrew asked me if I wanted to solo, to which I said "well, I've never flown here before". That wasn't too big a problem, and I ended up doing three full-stop, taxi-back landings. It was much less eventful than the first solo at Watsonville, which is a good thing. After that, we made a beeline back to Palo Alto, and came in over Stanford before making left-traffic for 31, over the city. 

## Flight 28: March 20, 2021
Interesting flight today on a gusty day with lots of thermal updrafts and downdrafts. I was also in a plane with vortex generators installed which made things more complicated in terms of landings, with a lot of float involved. It was also a massively high-pressure day, altimeter reading of 3034 or something like that. And there were pretty reasonable 5-10 knot crosswinds on both runways we used (san martin and Palo Alto). During our preflight, we talked about the ADF (automatic direction finder) which works over regular old AM radio frequency. They communicate with AM radios like our cars, but also with NDB: Non-directional beacons which are like lame versions of VORs that don't have discrete radials. 

This was a quality, not quantity kind of day. We only ended up doing 10 landings, but most of them were new kinds. We did 2 normal ones at E16, and one normal one at PAO. We also did three soft-field approaches three short-field approaches. We also did several soft-field takeoffs, and one short-field takeoff. It was also kind of an autonomy practice to make sure I'm ready to take an airplane down there myself. On takeoff, Palo Alto told me to fly heading 170, and when I talked to NorCal I told them I was "flying 170 direct pruneyard en route san martin", when I should have told them I was "flying 170, request direct pruneyard en route san martin". We cruised slowly at 90 knots, due to the little bit of turbulence and gusty winds. After IBM, we turn towards the Anderson spillway and descend to 1500, before turning along the hills to join the 45. If you don't go all the way to the hills, you end up joining on the downwind, which is nonstandard and we don't want to do it. We entered on the 45, did a normal full-stop with the crosswind inputs and it went well. After that, we practiced soft and short field takeoff and landing with the crosswind inputs, which went mostly well as well. It was pretty tiring but it was also my first time doing lots of those things and on a difficult wind day as well. I didn't get to solo for that reason. In the pattern operations, I was generally pretty good. I had pretty good crosswind inputs, but need more aileron into the wind. During the soft-field takeoffs, I need to be more aggressive about holding the nose level even though it looks like you're flying straight into the ground. On the soft-field touchdowns, I need to hold the airplane off the ground longer. The soft-field approach is very sensitive to crosswinds. The short-field approach needs some work. I was late to start and late on the flaps, and early to turn base a couple times, all of which adds up to being too high and too fast on final. It's important to pitch up for 1.3vs0 with full flaps and descend like an elevator in that situation. The last thing we want is speed. We did a simulated engine failure on the way back. It did pretty well, but I really need to work on my downwind spacing. I convinced myself I didn't have enough time to do something that I definitely had enough time to do, and so I moved to approach somewhere else. All I needed to do was get the downwind spacing okay and commit to my "landing". On the ground we discussed short and soft field approaches and soft field takeoff.

### Short-field approach-to-land discussion:
0. Ask ourselves several questions:
	- Why is the field short? Is it short because the runway is actually short, or is it short because we are clearing an obstacle?
	- Will we be turning base early? Either because of a hypothetical obstacle or because the person with us is calling our base?
	- Do we have to retract the flaps upon landing? More discussion on this from the January entry.
	- Where is the touchdown zone? Remember we have to be within 200ft of it.
1. Perform a normal approach until we turn base
2. Turn base at or before normal diagonal due to obstacle.
	- We may be following a different VASI, and may see red/red
3. Flaps to 20/30 pending necessary steepness of descent angle. Slow the airplane. May need to pull power fully idle. If so, pitch for 1.3vs0-5. If not, trim for 500 ft/min.
4. Turn final. Either:
	A. Decrease power and pitch down to maintain flying speed. Aim prior to the touchdown zone, and add power as necessary to drag the airplane to the touchdown zone
	B. Power increase, level off until clearing obstacle. Then, reduce power to idle (if nec.) and pitch/trim for 1.3-5. Match the glideslope (probably greater than 3.5 degrees.)
5. Pitch/trim to maintain 1.3vso-5 through short final and add power if necessary
6. Make final power reductionm and pitch/trim to maintain speed until we rotate into flare. Add slight power to soften rate of descent.
7. Touch down within 200 ft of power off and flare in a full-stall attitude
8. Retract flaps (or don't). Brake straight ahead, increase aileron into wind as necessary.
### Soft-field Take-off discussion:
Assumption A: ground is muddy and soft. Try not to skid during take-off
Assumption B: Expect short-filed climb-out due to time spent in ground-effect
0. Perform run-up as usual, but position airplane to turn onto runway as wide as possible, and add 10 degrees of flaps.
1. Take runwayu w/ flaps and full-up elevator. Ample power to elevate the nosewheel while turning. Turn with rudder only
2. Without stopping, apply take-off power in two steps. First, apply enough power to pop a wheelie, then apply full power.
3. Allow airplane to lift off into ground effect. Aggressively pitch level. Steer with the rudder.
4. Allow airplane to build airspeed, maintain flaps 10. Don't let airplane climb.
5. Rotate at VR or VX for obstacles
6. At a safe altitude, slowly retract flaps and climb as necessary at VY

## Flight 28: 3/13/2021
The main message of today was crosswinds, and a little bit of an introduction to soft-field approach-to-land. It was a difficult day for me but it was also good for me. I've got some things I need to work on, but it was really good for me to get some exposure to real crosswinds. We stayed in the palo alto pattern, which was unusually pretty empty. That was probably because of the crosswind encounter. The METAR was something crazy, like 180/16G19, but what we observed from our actual experience was more like 295/16G19. There was only ever a crosswind of five or six knots, but there were lots of gusts and a big headwind encounter to make things more complicated too.

I really need to work on the crosswind inputs (sideslips). I was getting better at it by the end of the lesson, but I am a little shy about the rudder. I almost need to go full rudder and fix the centerline alignment with aileron, rather than using the aileron to correct for the crosswind and applying opposite rudder to stay on the centerline. We had a light right crosswind at the threshold but a very strong left crosswind on the far end of the runway. So that combined with the fact that you slow down and the rudder loses authority, and you really have to lay on the left aileron during the rollout. After that, during a takeoff/go-around, you need to switch over to steering with the rudder promptly. There's just a lot going on. Doing all of the crosswind correction is really tiring. I am a little nervous about doing it solo once I start returning to Palo Alto by myself. The first several landings were kind of rough as I was warming up and the winds were weird. I had to go around a few times in a row at one point. I also needed to look at the altimeter a lot less, and rely more on timing and experience.  We talked about slowing down in the downwind, and that we can aim for 85 kts or so if it makes life easier. Because of the crosswind, we needed to do a lot of crab heading on the downwind leg. That was weird at first, but I got used to it by the end. We also kept getting extended by ATC (A Palo Alto special). We talked about not descending at all if they extend us. If they extend us, we don't descend until we're on final and we have a white white or red/white VASI. I was getting most of that but I wasn't making the necessary power changes when I knew I needed to. I need to focus more on just doing things rather than saying them out loud and then doing them. My turn timing and steepness is getting pretty good, but I need to be better about trusting myself to do it, rather than asking questions. I asked a lot of questions to which I knew the answer. We also practiced a few no-flaps landings, most of which went well, but one of them I completely forgot how to do it. For reference, we go to power 1500 on final and descend at 500 ft/min. Then, we go power idle and start to slow down and trim for L/DMax, before adding power as necessary. We also tried a couple of power-off approaches, which went pretty well! My glide judgement went fine and I was able to get the airplane on the ground both times. I still need to get better about applying the flaps as soon as the runway is made, and then pitching down to keep the flying speed. THe biggest problem I had was landing flat and fast a couple times. I need to have the power all the way off and be in a full-stall attitude when I am flaring. Will keep that in mind going forward.

Before we did our flight, we also discussed soft-field approach to land. Here's the steps from our discussion:
Objective: Land on soft, grassy, or muddy terrain. To do this, we need to be extra gentle on the nose gear and attempt to land with as little vertical speed as possible. To do this, we need more airspeed than usual. That makes the airplane harder to flare and more sensitive to crosswinds.

0. We perfrom a normal approach to land, as usual
1. Upon reaching short final, adjust or delay power reduction, before rotating into ground effect.
	- Carry as much power as is necessary to penetrate headwind encounter
	- While maintaining approach angle, add power to achieve a minimal descent rate
2. Upon rotating into ground effect, pitch for level with a slight power increase, in order to further minimize rate of descent
3. Make slight power reduction to allow for a soft touchdown in a nose-high attitude. Make sure crosswind inputs are as they should be
4. Apply sufficient power and up elevator to hold nose off the ground (pop a wheelie). Maintain aileron into the wind.
5. Reduce power to just above idle for roll out off of the runway, in a wide turn without applying brake.


## Flight 27/First XC: 3/6/2021

After the stage check with Libor (decided not to write that one up because it was pretty standard: bunch of landings and a simulated emergency and a couple other things), Andrew suggested we take advantage of the fact that we still have a week before daylight savings time starts and check off the nighttime requirements. Those requirements are one dual night XC and ten full-stop night landings, as well as three hours of night instruction. We decided to use this to take a little break from the patternwork and do something new. So we headed out to Modesto (which, at 63 NMi is just over the 50 NMi minimum requirement to be a cross-country flight.) We also took the time to introduce me to a few things related to cross country navigation, flight planning, and fuel planning. Andrew has come up with a brilliant format for a navigation log, which we use to help do navigational planning, fuel calculations, and estimate the corrections we are going to need to make for wind. I will do a more thorough blog post about how to do the nav logging once I get closer to doing solo cross-countries. We ended up deciding to use mostly GPS intersections, and finally the KMOD VOR for the last turn. The route was KPAO VPKGO SUNOL VPBCB VPALT KTCY 1Q4 KMOD, and the reverse route on the way back, except for a lack of 1Q4, which we only used because it was very close to our computed top of climb. We also talked to an actual weather briefer, which was an interesting experience. I appreciate people with such specialized skills. Hopefully weather briefers will continue to be a thing going forward.

Flying at night is strange. All sorts of weird optical illusions and terrain is kind of spooky. When we flew over mountains it was really dark and kind of weird. The other side is that because of how well lit the airplanes are, it's really easy to find other traffic nearby. Landing at night is really really weird. It actually gets harder as runways get wider. That's because the runway edges are lit, but the centerline usually isn't (I am not ready to fly at O'Hare or SFO yet.) So it feels like you're being swallowed up by the darkness as you hit the ground. The airplane we flew also had really wimpy ass taxi and landing lights, so it's even harder to see the runway. For this reason, we carry extra power and hold the airplane off the runway for a little longer. Modesto has a pretty long runway so it's not a big deal to use a little extra. We even did a couple of landings with no runway edge lighting. That was extra super disorienting. We headed back to Palo Alto and did five night landings there. It was similar but the runway was only half as wide. We were both really tired by the end of it. Finished at about 11:30. If it was the next week and we were post-daylight savings, it would have been 12:30 instead.
